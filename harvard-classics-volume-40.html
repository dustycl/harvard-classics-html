<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The aim in these three volumes of English Poetry has been to give, as far as the limits of space allowed, a substantial representation of the most distinguished poets of England and America for the last five hundred years. Among previous anthologies an especially wide recognition has been given by the best judges to Francis Turner Pal-grave's "Golden Treasury of the Best Songs and Lyrical Poems in the English Language," first published in 1861; and it has been thought best to make that collection the nucleus of the present one. All the poems originally selected by Mr. Palgrave have, accordingly, been retained, with the exception of those by Milton and Burns, which appear in the Harvard Classics in the complete editions of the poetical works of these two authors.</p>

<p>The larger scale of this collection has made it possible to ignore the limitation of most anthologies to lyrical poems, and to include a considerable number of long narrative and didactic poems. Thus we have been able to give the Prologue to Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," the most vivid series of types of character to be found in any English poem; the "Nun's Priest's Tale," one of the finest specimens of the beast fable; a large group of traditional ballads, including the almost epic "Gest of Robin Hood"; Pope's "Essay on Man"; Byron's "Prisoner of Chillon"; Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" and "Christabel"; Keats's "Eve of St. Agnes"; Shelley's "Adonais"; Tennyson's "Maud"; Longfellow's "Evangeline"; and many others rarely found in mixed collections. All these poems are given, in accordance with the general practise in this series, in their entirety.</p>

<p>In the case of Chaucer and other older authors, and of poems in the Scottish dialect, the meanings of obsolete and rare words have been given in the foot-notes. The poems of each author will be found together; an! the general arrangement is chronological.</p>

<p>THE PROLOGUE TO THE CANTERBURY TALES</p>

<p>WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote1 The droghte2 of Marche hath perced to the roote, And bathed every veyne in swich3 licour, Of which vertu engendred is the flour; Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth Inspired hath in every holt4 and heeth The tendre croppes,5 and the yonge sonne Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,6 And smale fowles maken melodye, That slepen al the night with open ye, (So priketh hem nature in hir corages:7 Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seken straunge strondes,8 To feme halwes,9 couthe10 in sondry londes; And specially, from every shires ende Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende, The holy blisful martir for to seke, That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.11</p>

<p>That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde; The chambres and the stables weren wyde, And wel we weren esed atte beste.16 And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste, So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,17 That I was of hir felawshipe anon, And made forward18 erly for to ryse, To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse.19</p>

A swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde; His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys. He was a janglere282 and a goliardeys,283 And that was most of sinne and harlotryes.

<p>He liftit up that noble lord,</p>

<p>Wi the saut tear in his ee, And hid him in the breaken bush,</p>

<p>On yonder lily lee.</p>

<p>The moon was clear, the day drew near,</p>

<p>The spears in flinters flew, But mony gallant Englishman</p>

<p>Ere day the Scotsman slew.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Montgomery he rode</p>

<p>Thro all the field in sight, And loud the name of Douglas still</p>

<p>He urgd wi a' his might.</p>

<p>The Gordons good, in English blood They steeped their hose and shoon,</p>

<p>The Lindsays flew like fire about, Till a' the fray was doon.]</p>

<p>"O yield thee, Piercy," said Sir Hugh,</p>

<p>"O yield, or ye shall die!" "Fain wad I yield," proud Piercy said,</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not yield to knave nor loun, Nor shalt thou yield to me; 17 Fellow.</p>

<p>"I will not yield to bush or brier,</p>

<p>Nor will I yield to thee; But I will yield to Lord Douglas,</p>

<p>[When Piercy knew it was Sir Hugh,</p>

<p>To dr/ue the deere w/th hound and home</p>

<p>Erie Pearcy took the way: The child may rue that is vnborne</p>

<p>The stout Erie of Northumberland</p>

<p>three sommers days to take,</p>

<p>1 Lives.</p>

<p>TRADITIONAL BALLADS</p>

<p>Who sent Erie Pearcy present word</p>

<p>he would prevent his sport; The English erle, not fearing that,</p>

<p>did to the woods resort,</p>

<p>W/th fifteen hundred bowmen bold,</p>

<p>All chosen men of might, Who knew ffull well in time of neede</p>

<p>to ayme their shafts arright.</p>

<p>The gallant greyhound[s] swiftly ran</p>

<p>to chase the fallow deere; On Munday they began to hunt,</p>

<p>ere daylight did appeare.</p>

<p>And long before high noone the had</p>

<p>a hundred fat buckes slaine; Then hauing dined, the drouyers went</p>

<p>to rouze the deare againe.</p>

<p>The bowmen mustered on the hills,</p>

<p>well able to endure; Theire backsids all w/th speciall care</p>

<p>that day were guarded sure.</p>

<p>The hounds ran swiftly through the woods</p>

<p>the nimble deere to take, That w/th their cryes the hills and dales</p>

<p>an eccho shrill did make.</p>

<p>Lord Pearcy to the querry2 went</p>

<p>to view the tender deere; Qoth he, "Erie Douglas promised once</p>

<p>this day to meete me heere;</p>

<p>"But if I thought he wold not come,</p>

<p>noe longer wold I stay." W/th that a braue younge gentlman</p>

<p>thus to the erle did say:</p>

<p>2 Slaughtered game.</p>

<p>CHEVY CHASE</p>

<p>"Loe, yonder doth Erie Douglas come,</p>

<p>hys men in armour bright; Full twenty hundred Scottish speres</p>

<p>all marching in our sight.</p>

<p>"All men of pleasant Tiuydale,</p>

<p>fast by the riuer Tweede:" "O ceaze your sportts!" Erie Pearcy said,</p>

<p>"and take your bowes w/th speede.</p>

<p>"And now w/th me, my countrymen,</p>

<p>yoz*r courage forth advance! For there was neuer champion yett,</p>

<p>in Scottland nor in Ffrance,</p>

<p>"That euer did on horsbacke come, [but], and if my hap it were,</p>

<p>I durst encounter man for man, w/th him to break a spere."</p>

<p>Erie Douglas on his milke-white steede,</p>

<p>most like a baron bold, Rode formost of his company,</p>

<p>whose armor shone like gold.</p>

<p>"Shew me," sayd hee, "whose men you bee</p>

<p>that hunt soe boldly heere, That w/thout my consent doe chase</p>

<p>and kill my fallow deere."</p>

<p>The first man that did answer make</p>

<p>was noble Pearcy hee, Who sayd, "Wee list not to declare</p>

<p>nor shew whose men wee bee;</p>

<p>"Yett wee will spend our deerest blood</p>

<p>thy cheefest harts to slay." Then Douglas swore a solempne oathe,</p>

<p>and thus in rage did say:</p>

<p>TRADITIONAL BALLADS</p>

<p>"Ere thus I will outbraued bee,</p>

<p>one of vs tow shall dye; I know thee well, an erle thou art;</p>

<p>Lord Pearcy, soe am I.</p>

<p>"But trust me, Pearcye, pittye it were,</p>

<p>and great offence, to kill Then any of these our guiltlesse men,</p>

<p>for they haue done none ill.</p>

<p>"Let thou and I the battell trye,</p>

<p>and set our men aside:" "Accurst bee [he!]" Erie Pearcye sayd,</p>

<p>"by whome it is denyed."</p>

<p>Then stept a gallant squire forth Witherington was his name</p>

<p>Who said, "I wold not haue it told To Henery our king, for shame,</p>

<p>"That ere my captaine fought on foote,</p>

<p>and I stand looking on. You bee two Erles," qoth Witherington,</p>

<p>"and I a squier alone;</p>

<p>'Tie doe the best that doe I may,</p>

<p>while I haue power to stand; While I haue power to weeld my sword,</p>

<p>I'lt fight w/th hart and hand."</p>

<p>Our English archers bent their bowes;</p>

<p>their harts were good and trew; Att the first flight of arrowes sent,</p>

<p>full foure score Scotts the slew.</p>

<p>To driue the deere w/th hound and home,</p>

<p>Douglas bade3 on the bent; Two captaines moued w/th mickle4 might,</p>

<p>their speres to shiuers went.</p>

<p>3 Abode.    4 Great.</p>

<p>CHEVY CHASE</p>

<p>They closed full fast on eu^rye side noe slackness there was found,</p>

<p>But many a gallant gentleman lay gasping on the ground.</p>

<p>0 Christ! it was great greeue5 to see how eche man chose his spere,</p>

<p>And how the blood out of their brests did gush like water cleare.</p>

<p>At last these two stout erles did meet, like captaines of great might;</p>

<p>Like lyons woode6 they layd on lode; the made a cruell fight.</p>

<p>The fought vntil they both did sweat, w/th swords of tempered Steele,</p>

<p>Till blood downe their cheekes like raine the trickling downe did feele.</p>

<p>"O yeeld thee, Pearcye!" Douglas sayd, "And in faith I will thee bringe</p>

<p>Where thou shall high advanced bee by lames our Scottish king.</p>

<p>"Thy ransome I will freely giue,</p>

<p>and this report of thee, Thou art the most couragious knight</p>

<p>[that ever I did see.]"</p>

<p>"Noe, Douglas!" quoth Erie Percy then, "thy profer I doe scorne;</p>

<p>1 will not yeelde to any Scott that euer yett was borne!"</p>

<p>W/th that there came an arrow keene,</p>

<p>out of an English bow, Which stroke Erie Douglas on the brest</p>

<p>a deepe and deadlye blow.</p>

<p>5 Grief.     6 Mad.</p>

<p>TRADITIONAL BALLADS</p>

<p>Who neuer sayd more words than these;</p>

<p>"Fight on, my merry men all! For why, my life is att [an] end,</p>

<p>lord Pearcy sees my fall."</p>

<p>Then leauing liffe, Erie Pearcy tooke</p>

<p>the dead man by the hand; Who said, "Erie Dowglas, for thy life,</p>

<p>Wold I had lost my land!</p>

<p>"O Christ! my verry hart doth bleed</p>

<p>for sorrow for thy sake, For sure, a more redoubted knight</p>

<p>mischance cold neuer take."</p>

<p>A knight amongst the Scotts there was which, saw Erie Douglas dye,</p>

<p>Who streight in hart did vow revenge vpon the Lord Pearcye.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Mountgomerye was he called, who, with a spere full bright,</p>

<p>Well mounted on a gallant steed, ran feircly through the fight,</p>

<p>And past the English archers all,</p>

<p>without all dread or feare, And through Erie Percyes body then</p>

<p>he thrust his hatfull spere.</p>

<p>W/th such a vehement force and might</p>

<p>his body he did gore, The staff ran through the other side</p>

<p>a large cioth-yard and more.</p>

<p>Thus did both those nobles dye, whose courage none cold staine;</p>

<p>An English archer then perceiued the noble erle was slaine.</p>

<p>CHEVY CHASE</p>

<p>He had [a] good bow in his hand,</p>

<p>made of a trusty tree; An arrow of a cloth-yard long</p>

<p>to the hard head haled hee.</p>

<p>Against S/r Hugh Mountgomerye</p>

<p>his shaft full right he sett; The grey-goose-winge that was there-on</p>

<p>in his harts bloode was wett.</p>

<p>This fight from breake of day did last</p>

<p>till setting of the sun, For when the rung the euening-bell</p>

<p>the battele scarse was done.</p>

<p>W/th stout Erie Percy there was slaine</p>

<p>S/r Iohn of Egerton, S/r Robert Harcliffe and S/r William,</p>

<p>S/r lames, that bold barron.</p>

<p>And with S/r George and S/r lames,</p>

<p>both knights of good account, Good S/r Raphe Rebbye there was slaine,</p>

<p>whose prowesse did surmount.</p>

<p>For Witherington needs must I wayle</p>

<p>as one in dolefull dumpes, For when his leggs were smitten of,</p>

<p>he fought vpon his stumpes.</p>

<p>And w/th Erie Dowglas there was slaine</p>

<p>S/r Hugh Mountgomerye, And S/r Charles Morrell, that from feelde</p>

<p>after on Humble-downe; In one day fifty knights were slayne,</p>

<p>w/th lords of great renowne.</p>

<p>And of the rest, of small account,</p>

<p>did many hundreds dye: Thus endeth the hunting in Cheuy Chase,</p>

<p>There dwelt a man in faire Westmerland, Ionne Armestrong men did him call,</p>

<p>He had nither lands nor rents coming in, Yet he kept eight score men in his hall.</p>

<p>He had horse and harness for them all, Goodly steeds were all milke-white;</p>

<p>O the golden bands an about their necks, And their weapons, they were all alike.</p>

<p>Newes then was brought unto the king That there was sicke a won1 as hee,</p>

<p>That lived lyke a bold out-law, And robbed all the north country.</p>

<p>The king he writt an letter then, A letter which was large and long;</p>

<p>He signed it with his owne hand, And he promised to doe him no wrong. 1 Such a one.</p>

<p>TRADITIONAL BALLADS</p>

<p>When this letter came Ionne' untill,</p>

<p>His heart it was as blythe as birds on the tree:</p>

<p>"Never was I sent for before any king, My father, my grandfather, nor none but mee.</p>

<p>"And if wee goe the king before,</p>

<p>I would we went most orderly; Every man of you shall have his scarlet cloak,</p>

<p>Laced with silver laces three.</p>

<p>"Every won of you shall have his velvett coat,</p>

<p>Laced with sillver lace so white; O the golden bands an about your necks,</p>

<p>Black hatts, white feathers, all alyke."</p>

<p>By the morrow morninge at ten of the clock,</p>

<p>Towards Edenburough gon was hee, And with him all his eight score men;</p>

<p>Good lord, it was a goodly sight for to see!</p>

<p>When Ionne came befower the king,</p>

<p>He fell downe on his knee; "O pardon, my soveraine leige," he said,</p>

<p>"O pardon my eight score men and mee!"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have no pardon, thou traytor strong,</p>

<p>For thy eight score men nor thee; For to-morrow morning by ten of the clock,</p>

<p>Both thou and them shall hang on the gallow-tree."</p>

<p>But Ionne look'd over his left shoulder, Good Lord, what a grevious look looked hee!</p>

<p>Saying, "Asking grace of a graceles face Why there is none for you nor me."</p>

<p>But Ionne had a bright sword by his side, And it was made of the mettle so free,</p>

<p>That had not the king stept his foot aside,</p>

<p>He had smitten his head from his faire bodde.</p>

<p>JOHNIE ARMSTRONG IO3</p>

<p>Saying, "Fight on, my merry men all,</p>

<p>And see that none of you be taine; For rather then men shall say we were hange'd,</p>

<p>'Thou art of my mind, then, bully Bewick,</p>

<p>And sworn-brethren will we be: If thou be a man, as I trow thou art,</p>

<p>Come over this ditch and fight with me.'</p>

<p>He flang his cloak from off his shoulders, His psalm-book out of his hand flung he,</p>

<p>He clapd his hand upon the hedge, And oer lap7 he right wantonly.</p>

<p>When Grahame did see his bully come, The salt tear stood long in his eye:</p>

<p>'Now needs must I say that thou art a man, That dare venture thy body to fight with me.</p>

<p>'Now I have a harness on my back;</p>

<p>I know that thou hath none on thine; But as little as thou hath on thy back,</p>

<p>He's taken his sword into his hand, He's tyed his horse unto a tree.</p>

<p>BEWICK AND GRAHAME</p>

<p>Now they fell to it with two broad swords, For two long hours fought Bewick and he;</p>

<p>Much sweat was to be seen on them both, But never a drop of blood to see.</p>

<p>Now Grahame gave Bewick an ackward stroke, An ackward stroke surely struck he;</p>

<p>He struck him now under the left breast, Then down to the ground as dead fell he.</p>

<p>'Arise, arise, O bully Bewick,</p>

<p>Arise, and speak three words to me!</p>

<p>Whether this be thy deadly wound,</p>

<p>Or God and good surgeons will mend thee.'</p>

<p>'O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, And pray do get thee far from me!</p>

<p>Thy sword is sharp, it hath wounded my heart, And so no further can I gae.</p>

<p>'O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, And get thee far from me with speed!</p>

<p>And get thee out of this country quite!</p>

<p>That none may know who's done the deed.'</p>

<p>'O if this be true, my bully dear, The words that thou dost tell to me,</p>

<p>The vow I made, and the vow I'll keep, I swear I'll be the first to die.'</p>

<p>Then he stuck his sword in a moudie-hill,8 Where he lap thirty good foot and three;</p>

<p>First he bequeathed his soul to God, And upon his own sword-point lap he.</p>

<p>Now Grahame he was the first that died, And then came Robin Bewick to see;</p>

<p>And talk of these two good old men,</p>

<p>Where they were making a pitiful moan.</p>

<p>With that bespoke now Robin Bewick: 'O man was I not much to blame?</p>

<p>I have lost one of the liveliest lads That ever was bred unto my name.'</p>

<p>With that bespoke my good lord Grahame: 'O man, I have lost the better block;</p>

<p>In ship, freight with rememberance</p>

<p>Of thoughts and pleasures past, He sails that hath in governance</p>

<p>My life while it will last: With scalding sighs, for lack of gale, Furthering his hope, that is his sail, Toward me, the swete port of his avail.</p>

<p>EARL OF SURREY</p>

<p>Alas! how oft in dreams I see</p>

<p>Those eyes that were my food; Which sometime so delighted me,</p>

<p>That yet they do me good: Wherewith I wake with his return Whose absent flame did make me burn: But when I find the lack, Lord! how I mourn!</p>

<p>When other lovers in arms across</p>

<p>Rejoice their chief delight, Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss</p>

<p>I stand the bitter night In my window where I may see Before the winds how the clouds flee: Lo! what a mariner love hath made mel</p>

<p>And in green waves when the salt flood</p>

<p>Doth rise by rage of wind, A thousand fancies in that mood</p>

<p>Assail my restless mind. Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe, That with the spoil of my heart did go, And left me; but alas! why did he so?</p>

<p>And when the seas wax calm again</p>

<p>To chase fro me annoy, My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;</p>

<p>So dread cuts off my joy. Thus in my wealth mingled with woe And of each thought a doubt doth grow; Now he comes! Will he come? Alas! no, no.</p>

<p>The Means to Attain Happy Life</p>

<p>Martial, the things that do attain</p>

<p>The happy life be these, I find: The richesse left, not got with pain;</p>

<p>The fruitful ground, the quiet mind;</p>

<p>The equal friend; no grudge, no strife; No charge of rule, nor governance;</p>

<p>GEORGE GASCOIGNE</p>

<p>Without disease, the healthful life; The household of continuance;</p>

<p>The mean diet, no delicate fare;</p>

<p>True wisdom join'd with simpleness; The night discharged of all care,</p>

<p>Where wine the wit may not oppress.</p>

<p>The faithful wife, without debate;</p>

<p>Such sleeps as may beguile the night: Contented with thine own estate</p>

<p>Ne wish for death, ne fear his might.</p>

<p>A Lover's Lullaby</p>

<p>Sing lullaby, as women do,</p>

<p>Wherewith they bring their babes to rest; And lullaby can I sing too,</p>

<p>As womanly as can the best. With lullaby they still the child; And if I be not much beguiled, Full many a wanton babe have I, Which must be still'd with lullaby.</p>

<p>First lullaby my youthful years,</p>

<p>It is now time to go to bed: For crooked age and hoary hairs</p>

<p>Have won the haven within my head. With lullaby, then, youth be still; With lullaby content thy will; Since courage quails and comes behind, Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind!</p>

<p>Next lullaby my gazing eyes,</p>

<p>Which wonted were to glance apace; For every glass may now suffice</p>

<p>To show the furrows in thy face.</p>

<p>NICHOLAS BRETON</p>

<p>With lullaby then wink awhile; With lullaby your looks beguile; Let no fair face, nor beauty bright, Entice you eft with vain delight.</p>

<p>And lullaby my wanton will;</p>

<p>Let reason's rule now reign thy thought; Since all too late I find by skill</p>

<p>How dear I have thy fancies bought; With lullaby now take thine ease, With lullaby thy doubts appease; For trust to this, if thou be still, My body shall obey thy will.</p>

<p>Thus lullaby my youth, mine eyes, My will, my ware, and all that was:</p>

<p>I can no more delays devise;</p>

<p>But welcome pain, let pleasure pass.</p>

<p>With lullaby now take your leave;</p>

<p>With lullaby your dreams deceive;</p>

<p>And when you rise with waking eye,</p>

<p>Remember then this lullaby.</p>

<p>Phillida and Coridon</p>

<p>In the merry month of May,</p>

<p>In a morn by break of day,</p>

<p>Forth I walk'd by the wood-side</p>

<p>When as May was in his pride:</p>

<p>There I spied all alone</p>

<p>Phillida and Coridon.</p>

<p>Much ado there was, God wot!</p>

<p>He would love and she would not.</p>

<p>She said, Never man was true;</p>

<p>He said, None was false to you.</p>

<p>He said, He had loved her long;</p>

<p>She said, Love should have no wrong.</p>

<p>A SWEET LULLABY</p>

<p>Coridon would kiss her then; She said, Maids must kiss no men Till they did for good and all; Then she made the shepherd call All the heavens to witness truth Never loved a truer youth. Thus with many a pretty oath, Yea and nay, and faith and troth, Such as silly shepherds use When they will not Love abuse, Love, which had been long deluded, Was with kisses sweet concluded; And Phillida, with garlands gay, Was made the Lady of the May.</p>

<p>A Sweet Lullaby From The Arbor of Amorous Devices</p>

<p>Come little babe, come silly soul,</p>

<p>Thy father's shame, thy mother's grief,</p>

<p>Born as I doubt to all our dole,</p>

<p>And to thyself unhappy chief: Sing lullaby, and lap it warm, Poor soul that thinks no creature harm.</p>

<p>Thou little think'st and less dost know</p>

<p>The cause of this thy mother's moan;</p>

<p>Thou want'st the wit to wail her woe,</p>

<p>And I myself am all alone:</p>

<p>Why dost thou weep? why dost thou wail And know'st not yet what thou dost ail.</p>

<p>Come, litde wretchah, silly heartl</p>

<p>Mine only joy, what can I more?</p>

<p>If there be any wrong thy smart,</p>

<p>That may the destinies implore: 'Twas I, I say, against my will, I wail the time, but be thou still.</p>

<p>ANONYMOUS And dost thou smile?  Oh, thy sweet face! Would God Himself He might thee see! No doubt thou wouldst soon purchase grace, I know right well, for thee and me:</p>

<p>But come to mother, babe, and play, For father false is fled away.</p>

<p>Sweet boy, if it by fortune chance Thy father home again to send, If death do strike me with his lance, Yet mayst thou me to him commend: If any ask thy mother's name, Tell how by love she purchased blame.</p>

<p>Then will his gentle heart soon yield:</p>

<p>I know him of a noble mind:</p>

<p>Although a lion in the field,</p>

<p>A lamb in town thou shalt him find: Ask blessing, babe, be not afraid, His sugar'd words hath me betray'd.</p>

<p>Then mayst thou joy and be right glad;</p>

<p>Although in woe I seem to moan,</p>

<p>Thy father is no rascal lad,</p>

<p>A noble youth of blood and bone:</p>

<p>His glancing looks, if he once smile, Right honest women may beguile.</p>

<p>Come, little boy, and rock asleep;</p>

<p>Sing lullaby and be thou still;</p>

<p>I, that can do naught else but weep,</p>

<p>Will sit by thee and wail my fill: God bless my babe, and lullaby From this thy father's quality.</p>

<p>But at the coming of the King of Heaven</p>

<p>All's set at six and seven;</p>

<p>We wallow in our sin,</p>

<p>Adieu Love, adieu Love, untrue Love;</p>

<p>Untrue Love, untrue Love, adieu Love;</p>

<p>Your mind is light, soon lost for new love.</p>

<p>So long as I was in your sight I was your heart, your soul, and treasure; And evermore you sobb'd and sigh'd Burning in flames beyond all measure:</p>

<p>Three days endured your love to me, And it was lost in other three! Adieu Love, adieu Love, untrue Love, Untrue Love, untrue Love, adieu Love; Your mind is light, soon lost for new love.</p>

<p>Another Shepherd you did see</p>

<p>To whom your heart was soon enchained;</p>

<p>Full soon your love was leapt from me,</p>

<p>Full soon my place he had obtained.</p>

<p>Soon came a third, your love to win, And we were out and he was in.</p>

<p>Adieu Love, adieu Love, untrue Love,</p>

<p>Beauty Bathing</p>

<p>Beauty sat bathing by a spring Where fairest shades did hide her; The winds blew calm, the birds did sing, The cool streams ran beside her. My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye</p>

<p>To see what was forbidden: But better memory said, fie! So vain desire was chidden: Hey nonny nonny O! Hey nonny nonny!</p>

<p>Into a slumber then I fell,</p>

<p>When fond imagination Seemed to see, but could not tell</p>

<p>Her feature or her fashion. But, ev'n as babes in dreams do smile,</p>

<p>And sometimes fall a-weeping, So I awaked, as wise this while</p>

<p>As when I fell a-sleeping: Hey nonny nonny O! Hey nonny nonny!</p>

<p>RICHARD EDWARDES [1523-1566]</p>

<p>Amantium Irae</p>

<p>In going to my naked bed as one that would have slept, I heard a wife sing to her child, that long before had wept; She sighed sore and sang full sweet, to bring the babe to rest, That would not cease but cried still, in sucking at her breast. She was full weary of her watch, and grieved with her child, She rocked it and rated it, till that on her it smiled. Then did she say, Now have I found this proverb true to prove, The falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love.</p>

<p>202 RICHARD EDWARDES</p>

<p>Then took I paper, pen, and ink, this proverb for to write, In register for to remain of such a worthy wight: As she proceeded thus in song unto her little brat, Much matter utter'd she of weight, in place whereas she sat: And proved plain there was no beast, nor creature bearing life, Could well be known to live in love without discord and strife: Then kissed she her little babe, and sware by God above, The falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love.</p>

<p>She said that neither king nor prince nor lord could live aright, Until their puissance they did prove, their manhood and their might. When manhood shall be matched so that fear can take no place, Then weary works make warriors each other to embrace, And left their force that failed them, which did consume the rout, That might before have lived their time, their strength and nature out: Then did she sing as one that thought no man could her reprove, The falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love.</p>

<p>She said she saw no fish nor fowl, nor beast within her haunt, That met a stranger in their kind, but could give it a taunt: Since flesh might not endure, but rest must wrath succeed, And force the fight to fall to play in pasture where they feed, So noble nature can well end the work she hath begun, And bridle well that will not cease her tragedy in some: Thus in song she oft rehearsed, as did her well behove. The falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love.</p>

<p>I marvel much pardy (quoth she) for to behold the rout, To see man, woman, boy and beast, to toss the world about: Some kneel, some crouch, some beck, some check, and some can smoothly smile</p>

<p>And some embrace others in arm, and there think many a wile, Some stand aloof at cap and knee, some humble and some stout, Yet are they never friends in deed until they once fall out: Thus ended she her song and said, before she did remove, The falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love.</p>

<p>His Pilgrimage</p>

<p>Give me my scallop-shell of quiet, My staff of faith to walk upon,</p>

<p>My scrip of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation,</p>

<p>My gown of glory, hope's true gage;</p>

<p>And thus I'll take my pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Blood must be my body's balmer;</p>

<p>No other balm will there be given; Whilst my soul,-like quiet palmer,</p>

<p>Travelleth towards the land of heaven; Over the silver mountains, Where spring the nectar fountains: There will I kiss The bowls of bliss; And drink mine everlasting fill Upon every milken hill. My soul will be a-dry before; But, after, it will thirst no more.</p>

<p>Then by that happy blissful day,</p>

<p>More peaceful pilgrims I shall see, That have cast off their rags of clay, And walk apparelled fresh like me. I'll take them first To quench their thirst And taste of nectar suckets, At those clear wells Where sweetness dwells, Drawn up by saints in crystal.buckets.</p>

<p>And when our bottles and all we Are filled with immortality, Then the blessed paths we'll travel, Strowed with rubies thick as gravel;</p>

<p>And He hath angels, but no fees.</p>

<p>And when the grand twelve-million jury</p>

<p>Of our sins, with direful fury,</p>

<p>Against our souls black verdicts give,</p>

<p>Christ pleads His death, and then we live.</p>

<p>Be Thou my speaker, taintless pleader,</p>

<p>And want a head to dine at noon,</p>

<p>Just at the stroke, when my veins start and spread,</p>

<p>Go, Soul, the body's guest,</p>

<p>Not loved unless they give, Not strong, but by a faction:</p>

<p>Tell men of high condition, That manage the estate,</p>

<p>Their purpose is ambition, Their practice only hate:</p>

<p>And if they once reply,</p>

<p>Then give them all the lie.</p>

<p>Tell them that brave it most, They beg for more by spending,</p>

<p>Who, in their greatest cost,</p>

<p>Seek nothing but commending:</p>

<p>And if they make reply,</p>

<p>Then give them all the lie.</p>

<p>Tell zeal it wants devotion;</p>

<p>Tell love it is but lust; Tell time it is but motion;</p>

<p>Tell flesh it is but dust: And wish them not reply, For thou must give the lie.</p>

<p>Tell age it daily wasteth;</p>

<p>Tell honour how it alters; Tell beauty how she blasteth;</p>

<p>Tell favour how it falters: And as they shall reply, Give every one the lie.</p>

<p>Tell wit how much it wrangles In tickle points of niceness;</p>

<p>SIR WALTER RALEIGH</p>

<p>Tell wisdom she entangles Herself in over-wiseness: And when they do reply, Straight give them both the lie.</p>

<p>Tell physic of her boldness;</p>

<p>Tell skill it is pretension; Tell charity of coldness;</p>

<p>Tell law it is contention: And as they do reply, So give them still the lie.</p>

<p>Tell fortune of her blindness;</p>

<p>Tell nature of decay; Tell friendship of unkindness;</p>

<p>Tell justice of delay; And if they will reply, Then give them all the lie.</p>

<p>Tell arts they have no soundness,</p>

<p>But vary by esteeming; Tell schools they want profoundness,</p>

<p>And stand too much on seeming: If arts and schools reply, Give arts and schools the lie.</p>

<p>Tell faith it's fled the city;</p>

<p>Tell how the country erreth; Tell, manhood shakes off pity;</p>

<p>Tell, virtue least preferreth: And if they do reply, Spare not to give the lie.</p>

<p>So when thou hast, as I</p>

<p>Commanded thee, done blabbing, Although to give the lie</p>

<p>Deserves no less than stabbing, Stab at thee he that will, No stab the soul can kill.</p>

<p>found in his bible in the gate-house at westminster. said to have been written the night before his death</p>

<p>Even such is time, that takes in trust Our youth, our joys, our all we have,</p>

<p>And pays us but with earth and dust; Who, in the dark and silent grave,</p>

<p>When we have wandered all our ways,</p>

<p>Shuts up the story of our days;</p>

<p>But from this earth, this grave, this dust,</p>

<p>My God shall raise me up, I trust.</p>

<p>50 What Is Our Life</p>

<p>What is our life? The play of passion. Our mirth? The music of division: Our mothers' wombs the tiring-houses be, Where we are dressed for life's short comedy. The earth the stage; Heaven the spectator is, Who sits and views whosoe'er doth act amiss. The graves which hide us from the scorching sun Are like drawn curtains when the play is done. Thus playing post we to our latest rest, And then we die in earnest, not in jest.</p>

<p>5/ My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is</p>

<p>My mind to me a kingdom is;</p>

<p>Such present joys therein I find, That it excels all other bliss</p>

<p>That earth affords or grows by kind: Though much I want that most would have, Yet still my mind forbids to crave.</p>

<p>No princely pomp, no wealthy store,</p>

<p>No force to win the victory, No wily wit to salve a sore,</p>

<p>SIR EDWARD DYER</p>

<p>No shape to feed a loving eye; To none of these I yield as thrall; For why? my mind doth serve for all.</p>

<p>I see how plenty surfeits oft, And hasty climbers soon do fall;</p>

<p>I see that those which are aloft Mishap doth threaten most of all:</p>

<p>They get with toil, they keep with fear:</p>

<p>Such cares my mind could never bear.</p>

<p>Content I live, this is my stay;</p>

<p>I seek no more than may suffice; I press to bear no haughty sway;</p>

<p>Look, what I lack my mind supplies. Lo, thus I triumph like a king, Content with that my mind doth bring.</p>

<p>Some have too much, yet still do crave;</p>

<p>I little have, and seek no more. They are but poor, though much they have,</p>

<p>And I am rich with little store; They poor, I rich; they beg, I give; They lack, I leave; they pine, I live.</p>

<p>I laugh not at another's loss, I grudge not at another's gain;</p>

<p>No worldly waves my mind can toss; My state at one doth still remain:</p>

<p>I fear no foe, I fawn no friend;</p>

<p>I loathe not life, nor dread my end.</p>

<p>Some weigh their pleasure by their lust, Their wisdom by their rage of will;</p>

<p>Their treasure is their only trust, A cloaked craft their store of skill;</p>

<p>But all the pleasure that I find</p>

<p>Is to maintain a quiet mind.</p>

<p>My wealth is health and perfect ease,</p>

<p>My conscience clear my chief defence; I neither seek by bribes to please,</p>

<p>My true-love hath my heart, and I have his, By just exchange one for another given: I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss, There never was a better bargain driven: My true-love hath my heart, and I have his.</p>

<p>His heart in me keeps him and me in one, My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides: He loves my heart, for once it was his own, I cherish his because in me it bides:</p>

<p>My true-love hath my heart, and I have his.</p>

<p>Loving in Truth</p>

<p>Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, That She, dear She, might take some pleasure of my pain; Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know, Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain; I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe, Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain; Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain. But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay;</p>

<p>SIR PHILIP SIDNEY</p>

<p>Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows; And others' feet still seemed but strangers in my way. Thus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes, Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite. "Fool," said my Muse to me, "look in thy heart, and wiite</p>

<p>Be Your Words Made, Good Sir, of Indian Ware</p>

<p>Be your words made, good Sir, of Indian ware, That you allow me them by so small rate? Or do you cutted Spartans imitate? Or do you mean my tender ears to spare That to my questions you so total are? When I demand of Phoenix-Stella's state, You say, forsooth, you left her well of late:</p>

<p>0 God, think you that satisfies my care?</p>

<p>1 would know whether she did sit or walk;</p>

<p>How clothed; how waited on; sighed she, or smiled; Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk; With what pastime Time's journey she beguiled; If her lips deigned to sweeten my poor name: Say all; and, all well said, still say the same.</p>

<p>To Sleep</p>

<p>Come, Sleep; O Sleep! the certain knot of peace, The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe, The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release, Th' indifferent judge between the high and low; With shield of proof, shield me from out the prease Of those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw:</p>

<p>0 make in me those civil wars to cease;</p>

<p>1 will good tribute pay, if thou do so.</p>

<p>Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed, A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light, A rosy garland and a weary head: And if these things, as being thine by right, Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me, Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.</p>

<p>THOMAS LODGE</p>

<p>To the Moon</p>

<p>With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the skies!</p>

<p>How silently, and with how wan a face!</p>

<p>What! may it be that even in heavenly place</p>

<p>That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?</p>

<p>Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes</p>

<p>Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case:</p>

<p>I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace</p>

<p>To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.</p>

<p>Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,</p>

<p>Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?</p>

<p>Are beauties there as proud as here they be ?</p>

<p>Do they above love to be loved, and yet</p>

<p>Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?</p>

<p>Do they call 'virtue' thereungratefulness?</p>

<p>THOMAS LODGE [1558-1625]</p>

<p>Rosalind's Madrigal</p>

<p>Love in my bosom like a bee</p>

<p>Doth suck his sweet: Now with his wings he plays with me,</p>

<p>Now with his feet. Within mine eyes he makes his nest, His bed amidst my tender breast; My kisses are his daily feast And yet he robs me of my rest:</p>

<p>Ah! wanton, will ye?</p>

<p>And if I sleep, then percheth he</p>

<p>With pretty flight, And makes his pillow of my knee</p>

<p>The livelong night.</p>

<p>Strike I my lute, he tunes the string; He music plays if so I sing, He lends me every lovely thing, Yet cruel he my heart doth sting: Whist, wanton, still ye!</p>

<p>THOMAS LODGE</p>

<p>Else I with roses every day</p>

<p>Will whip you hence,</p>

<p>And bind you, when you long to play, For your offence.</p>

<p>I'll shut mine eyes to keep you in;</p>

<p>I'll make you fast it for your sin;</p>

<p>I'll count your power not worth a pin.</p>

<p>Alas! what hereby shall I win If he gainsay me?</p>

<p>What if I beat the wanton boy</p>

<p>With many a rod? He will repay me with annoy,</p>

<p>Because a god. Then sit thou safely on my knee; Then let thy bower my bosom be; Lurk in mine eyes, I like of thee; O Cupid, so thou pity me,</p>

<p>Spare not, but play thee!</p>

<p>Rosaline</p>

<p>Like to the clear in highest sphere Where all imperial glory shines, Of selfsame colour is her hair Whether unfolded, or in twines:</p>

<p>Heigh ho, fair Rosaline! Her eyes are sapphires set in snow Resembling heaven by every wink; The Gods do fear whenas they glow, And I do tremble when I think</p>

<p>Heigh ho, would she were mine!</p>

<p>Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud That beautifies Aurora's face, Or like the silver crimson shroud That Phoebus' smiling looks doth grace;</p>

<p>Heigh ho, fair Rosaline! Her lips are like two budded roses Whom ranks of lilies neighbour nigh, Within which bounds she balm encloses</p>

<p>THOMAS LODGE</p>

<p>Apt to entice a deity:</p>

<p>Heigh ho, would she were mine!</p>

<p>Her neck is like a stately tower Where Love himself imprison'd lies, To watch for glances every hour From her divine and sacred eyes:</p>

<p>Heigh ho, fair Rosaline! Her paps are centres of delight, Her breasts are orbs of heavenly frame, Where Nature moulds the dew of light To feed perfection with the same:</p>

<p>Heigh ho, would she were mine!</p>

<p>With orient pearl, with ruby red, With marble white, with sapphire blue Her body every way is fed, Yet soft in touch and sweet in view:</p>

<p>Heigh ho, fair Rosaline! Nature herself her shape admires; The Gods are wounded in her sight; And Love forsakes his heavenly fires And at her eyes his brand doth light:</p>

<p>Heigh ho, would she were mine!</p>

<p>Then muse not, Nymphs, though I bemoan The absence of fair Rosaline, Since for a fair there's fairer none, Nor for her virtues so divine: Heigh ho, fair Rosaline! Heigh ho, my heart! would God that she were mine!</p>

<p>Phillis</p>

<p>Love guards the roses of thy lips</p>

<p>And flies about them like a bee; If I approach he forward skips,</p>

<p>And if I kiss he stingeth me.</p>

<p>Love in thine eyes doth build his bower, And sleeps within their pretty shine;</p>

<p>The Burning Babe</p>

<p>As I in hoary winter's night</p>

<p>Stood shivering in the snow, Surprised I was with sudden heat</p>

<p>Which made my heart to glow; And lifting up a fearful eye</p>

<p>To view what fire was near, A pretty babe all burning bright</p>

<p>Did in the air appear; Who, scorched with excessive heat,</p>

<p>Such floods of tears did shed, As though His floods should quench His flames,</p>

<p>Which with His tears were bred: 'Alas!' quoth He, 'but newly born</p>

<p>In fiery heats I fry,</p>

<p>SAMUEL DANIEL</p>

<p>Yet none approach to warm their hearts Or feel my fire but I!</p>

<p>'My faultless breast the furnace is;</p>

<p>The fuel, wounding thorns; Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke;</p>

<p>The ashes, shames and scorns; The fuel Justice layeth on,</p>

<p>And Mercy blows the coals, The metal in this furnace wrought</p>

<p>Are men's defiled souls: For which, as now on fire I am</p>

<p>To work them to their good, So will I melt into a bath,</p>

<p>To wash them in my blood.' With this He vanish'd out of sight</p>

<p>And swiftly shrunk away, And straight I called unto mind</p>

<p>That it was Christmas Day.</p>

<p>SAMUEL DANIEL [7562-/6/9] Beauty, Time, and Love Sonnets 1</p>

<p>Fair is my Love and cruel as she's fair; Her brow-shades frown, although her eyes are sunny, Her smiles are lightning, though her pride despair, And her disdains are gall, her favours honey: A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour, Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love; The wonder of all eyes that look upon her, Sacred on earth, design'd a Saint above. Chastity and Beauty, which were deadly foes, Live reconciled friends within her brow; And had she Pity to conjoin with those, Then who had heard the plaints I utter now? For had she not been fair, and thus unkind, My Muse had slept, and none had known my mind.</p>

<p>220</p>

<p>SAMUEL DANIEL</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>My spotless love hovers with purest wings, About the temple of the proudest frame, Where blaze those lights, fairest of earthly things, Which clear our clouded world with brightest flame. My ambitious thoughts, confined in her face Affect no honour but what she can give; My hopes do rest in limits of her grace; I weigh no comforts unless she relieve. For she, that can my heart imparadise, Holds in her fairest hand what dearest is; My Fortune's wheel's the circle of her eyes, Whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss.</p>

<p>All my life's sweet consists in her alone;</p>

<p>So much I love the most Unloving one.</p>

<p>in</p>

<p>And yet I cannot reprehend the flight Or blame th' attempt presuming so to soar; The mounting venture for a high delight Did make the honour of the fall the more. For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore? Danger hath honour, great designs their fame; Glory doth follow, courage goes before; And though th' event oft answers not the same Suffice that high attempts have never shame. The mean observer, whom base safety keeps, Lives without honour, dies without a name, And in eternal darkness ever sleeps. And therefore, Delia, 'tis to me no blot To have attempted, tho' attain'd thee not.</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>When men shall find thy flow'r, thy glory, pass, And thou with careful brow, sitting alone, Received hast this message from thy glass, That tells the truth and says that All is gone; Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st, Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining:</p>

<p>SAMUEL DANIEL</p>

<p>221</p>

<p>I that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning. The world shall find this miracle in me, That fire can burn when all the matter's spent: Then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see, And that thou wast unkind thou may'st repent. Thou may'st repent that thou hast scorn'd my tears, When Winter snows upon thy sable hairs.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>Beauty, sweet Love, is like the morning dew, Whose short refresh upon the tender green Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth show, And straight 'tis gone as it had never been. Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish, Short is the glory of the blushing rose; The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish, Yet which at length thou must be forced to lose. When thou, surcharged with burthen of thy years, Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth; And that, in Beauty's Lease expired, appears The Date of Age, the Calends of our Death But ah, no more!this must not be foretold, For women grieve to think they must be old.</p>

<p>vi</p>

<p>I must not grieve my Love, whose eyes would read Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smile; Flowers have time before they come to seed, And she is young, and now must sport the while. And sport, Sweet Maid, in season of these years, And learn to gather flowers before they wither; And where the sweetest blossom first appears, Let Love and Youth conduct thy pleasures thither. Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air, And calm the tempest which my sighs do raise; Pity and smiles do best become the fair; Pity and smiles must only yield thee praise. Make me to say when all my griefs are gone, Happy the heart that sighed for such a one!</p>

<p>vii</p>

<p>Let others sing of Knights and Paladines</p>

<p>In aged accents and untimely words,</p>

<p>Paint shadows in imaginary lines,</p>

<p>Which well the reach of their high wit records:</p>

<p>But I must sing of thee, and those fair eyes</p>

<p>Authentic shall my verse in time to come;</p>

<p>When yet th' unborn shall say, Lo, where she lies!</p>

<p>Whose beauty made him spea\, that else was dumb!</p>

<p>These are the arcs, the trophies I erect,</p>

<p>That fortify thy name against old age;</p>

<p>And these thy sacred virtues must protect</p>

<p>Against the Dark, and Time's consuming rage. Though th' error of my youth in them appear, Suffice, they show I lived, and loved thee dear.</p>

<p>To Sleep</p>

<p>Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night, Brother to Death, in silent darkness born, Relieve my languish, and restore the light; With dark forgetting of my care return. And let the day be time enough to mourn The shipwreck of my illadventured youth: Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn, Without the torment of the night's untruth. Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires, To model forth the passions of the morrow; Never let rising Sun approve you liars, To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow: Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain, And never wake to feel the day's disdain.</p>

<p>Agincourt Fair stood the wind for France When we our sails advance, Nor now to prove our chance Longer will tarry;</p>

<p>MICHAEL DRAYTON</p>

<p>But putting to the main, At Caux, the mouth of Seine, With all his martial train Landed King Harry.</p>

<p>And taking many a fort, Furnish'd in warlike sort, Marcheth tow'rds Agincourt</p>

<p>In happy hour; Skirmishing day by day With those that stopp'd his way, Where the French gen'ral lay</p>

<p>With all his power.</p>

<p>Which, in his height of pride, King Henry to deride, His ransom to provide</p>

<p>Unto him sending; Which he neglects the while As from a nation vile, Yet with an angry smile</p>

<p>Their fall portending.</p>

<p>And turning to his men, Quoth our brave Henry then, 'Though they to one be ten</p>

<p>Be not amazed: Yet have we well begun; Battles so bravely won Have ever to the sun</p>

<p>By fame been raised.</p>

<p>'And for myself (quoth he) This my full rest shall be: England ne'er mourn for me</p>

<p>Nor more esteem me: Victor I will remain Or on this earth lie slain, Never shall she sustain</p>

<p>'Poitiers and Cressy tell,</p>

<p>When most their pride did swell,</p>

<p>Under our swords they fell:</p>

<p>No less our skill is Than when our grandsire great, Claiming the regal seat, By many a warlike feat</p>

<p>Lopp'd the French lilies.'</p>

<p>The Duke of York so dread The eager vaward led; With the main Henry sped</p>

<p>Among his henchmen. Excester had the rear, A braver man not there; O Lord, how hot they were</p>

<p>On the false Frenchmen!</p>

<p>They now to fight are gone, Armour on armour shone, Drum now to drum did groan,</p>

<p>To hear was wonder. That with the cries they make The very earth did shake: Trumpet to trumpet spake,</p>

<p>Thunder to thunder.</p>

<p>Well it thine age became, O noble Erpingham, Which didst the signal aim</p>

<p>To our hid forces! When from a meadow by, Like a storm suddenly The English archery</p>

<p>Stuck the French horses.</p>

<p>With Spanish yew so strong, Arrows a cloth-yard long That like to serpents stung, Piercing the weather;</p>

<p>MICHAEL DRAYTON</p>

<p>None from his fellow starts, But playing manly parts, And like true English hearts Stuck close together.</p>

<p>When down their bows they threw, And forth their bilbos drew, And on the French they flew,</p>

<p>Not one was tardy; Arms were from shoulders sent, Scalps to the teeth were rent, Down the French peasants went</p>

<p>Our men were hardy.</p>

<p>This while our noble king, His broadsword brandishing, Down the French host did ding</p>

<p>As to o'erwhelm it; And many a deep wound lent, His arms with blood besprent, And many a cruel dent</p>

<p>Bruised his helmet.</p>

<p>Gloster, that duke so good, Next of the royal blood, For famous England stood</p>

<p>With his brave brother; Clarence, in steel so bright, Though but a maiden knight, Yet in that furious fight</p>

<p>Scarce such another.</p>

<p>Warwick in blood did wade, Oxford the foe invade, And cruel slaughter made</p>

<p>Still as they ran up; Suffolk his axe did ply, Beaumont and Willoughby Bare them right doughtily,</p>

<p>Ferrers and Fanhope.</p>

<p>MICHAEL DRAYTON</p>

<p>Upon Saint Crispin's Day Fought was this noble fray, Which fame did not delay</p>

<p>To England to carry; O when shall English men With such acts fill a pen? Or England breed again</p>

<p>To the Virginian Voyage</p>

<p>You brave heroic minds Worthy your country's name, That honour still pursue; Go and subdue! Whilst loitering hinds</p>

<p>Lurk here at home with shame.</p>

<p>Britons, you stay too long: Quickly aboard bestow you, And with a merry gale Swell your stretch'd sail With vows as strong</p>

<p>As the winds that blow you.</p>

<p>Your course securely steer,</p>

<p>West and by south forth keep! Rocks, lee-shores, nor shoals When Eolus scowls You need not fear; So absolute the deep.</p>

<p>And cheerfully at sea Success you still entice To get the pearl and gold, And ours to hold Virginia, Earth's only paradise.</p>

<p>All greater than your wish.</p>

<p>And the ambitious vine</p>

<p>Crowns with his purple mass The cedar reaching high To kiss the sky, The cypress, pine, And useful sassafras.</p>

<p>To whom the Golden Age Still nature's laws doth give, No other cares attend, But them to defend From winter's rage, That long there doth not live.</p>

<p>When as the luscious smell Of that delicious land Above the seas that flows The clear wind throws, Your hearts to swell Approaching the dear strand;</p>

<p>In kenning of the shore</p>

<p>(Thanks to God first given) O you the happiest men, Be frolic then! Let cannons roar,</p>

<p>Frighting the wide heaven.</p>

<p>Along the shoare of silver streaming Themmes;</p>

<p>Whose rutty Bancke, the which his River hemmes,</p>

<p>Was paynted all with variable flowers,</p>

<p>And all the meades adornd with daintie gemmes</p>

<p>Fit to decke maydens bowres,</p>

<p>And crowne their Paramours</p>

<p>Against the Brydale dale, which is not long:</p>

<p>Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>There, in a Meadow, by the Rivers side, A Flocke of Nymphes I chaunced to espy, All lovely Daughters of the Flood thereby,</p>

<p>With goodly greenish locks, all loose untyde,</p>

<p>As each had bene a Bryde;</p>

<p>And each one had a little wicker basket,</p>

<p>Made of fine twigs, entrayled curiously,</p>

<p>In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,</p>

<p>And with fine Fingers cropt full featously</p>

<p>The tender stalkes on hye.</p>

<p>Of every sort, which in that Meadow grew,</p>

<p>They gathered some; the Violet, pallid blew,</p>

<p>The little Dazie, that at evening closes,</p>

<p>The virgin Lillie, and the Primrose trew,</p>

<p>With store of vermeil Roses,</p>

<p>To decke their Bridegromes posies</p>

<p>Against the Brydale day, which was not long:</p>

<p>Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>With that I saw two Swannes of goodly hewe Come softly swimming downe along the Lee; Two fairer Birds I yet did never see; The snow, which doth the top of Pindus strew, Did never whiter shew;</p>

<p>Nor Jove himselfe, when he a Swan would be, For love of Leda, whiter did appeare; Yet Leda was (they say) as white as he, Yet not so white as these, nor nothing neare; So purely white they were,</p>

<p>That even the gentle streame, the which them bare,</p>

<p>Seem'd foule to them, and bad his billowes spare</p>

<p>To wet their silken feathers, least they might</p>

<p>Soyle their fayre plumes with water not so fayre,</p>

<p>And marre their beauties bright,</p>

<p>That shone as heavens light,</p>

<p>Against their Brydale day, which was not long:</p>

<p>Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Them seem'd they never saw a sight so fayre, Of Fowles, so lovely, that they sure did deeme Them heavenly borne, or to be that same payre Which through the Skie draw Venus silver Teeme: For sure they did not seeme To be begot of any earthly Seede, But rather Angels, or of Angels breede; Yet were they bred of Somers-heat, they say, In sweetest Season, when each Flower and weede The earth did fresh aray; So fresh they seem'd as day, Even as their Brydale day, which was not long: Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>Then forth they all out of their baskets drew Great store of Flowers, the honour of the field, That to the sense did fragrant odours yield, All which upon those goodly Birds they threw And all the Waves did strew, That like old Peneus Waters they did seeme, When downe along by pleasant Tempes shore, Scattred with Flowres, through Thessaly they streeme, That they appeare, through Lillies plenteous store, Like a Brydes Chamber flore.</p>

<p>Two of those Nymphes, meane while, two Garlands bound Of freshest Flowres which in that Mead they found, The which presenting all in trim Array, Their snowie Foreheads therewithall they crownd, Whil'st one did Sing this Lay, Prepar'd against that Day, Against their Brydale day, which was not long: Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>'Ye gentle Birdes! the worlds faire ornament, And heavens glorie, whom this happie hower Doth leade unto your lovers blisfull bower, Joy may you have, and gentle hearts content Of your loves couplement; And let faire Venus, that is Queene of love, With her heart-quelling Sonne upon you smile,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Whose smile, they say, hath vertue to remove All Loves dislike, and friendships faultie guile For ever to assoile.</p>

<p>Let endlesse Peace your steadfast hearts accord,</p>

<p>And blessed Plentie wait upon your bord;</p>

<p>And let your bed with pleasures chast abound,</p>

<p>That fruitfull issue may to you afford,</p>

<p>Which may your foes confound,</p>

<p>And make your joyes redound</p>

<p>Upon your Brydale day, which is not long:</p>

<p>Sweete Themmes! runne softlie, till I end my Song.'</p>

<p>So ended she; and all the rest around To her redoubled that her undersong, Which said their brydale daye should not be long: And gentle Eccho from the neighbor ground Their accents did resound. So forth those joyous Birdes did passe along, Adowne the Lee, that to them murmurde low, As he would speake, but that he lackt a tong, Yet did by signes his glad affection show, Making his streame run slow. And all the foule which in his flood did dwell Gan flock about these twaine, that did excell The rest, so far as Cynthia doth shend The lesser starres. So they, enranged well, Did on those two attend, And their best service lend Against their wedding day, which was not long: Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>At length they all to mery London came, To mery London, my most kyndly Nurse, That to me gave this Lifes first native sourse, Though from another place I take my name, An house of auncient fame:</p>

<p>There when they came, whereas those bricky towres The which on Themmes brode aged backe doe ryde, Where now the studious Lawyers have their bowers, There whylome wont the Templar Knights to byde,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER 233</p>

<p>Till they decayd through pride: Next whereunto there standes a stately place, Where oft I gayned giftes and goodly grace Of that great Lord, which therein wont to dwell, Whose want too well now feeles my freendles case; But ah! here fits not well Olde woes, but joyes, to tell Against the Brydale daye, which is not long: Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>Yet therein now doth lodge a noble Peer,</p>

<p>Great Englands glory, and the Worlds wide wonder,</p>

<p>Whose dreadfull name late through all Spaine did thunder,</p>

<p>And Hercules two pillors standing neere</p>

<p>Did make to quake and feare:</p>

<p>Faire branch of Honor, flower of Chevalrie!</p>

<p>That fillest England with thy triumphes fame,</p>

<p>Joy have thou of thy noble victorie,</p>

<p>And endlesse happinesse of thine owne name</p>

<p>That promiseth the same;</p>

<p>That through thy prowesse, and victorious armes, Thy country may be freed from forraine harmes; And great Elisaes glorious name may ring Through al the world, fil'd with thy wide Alarmes, Which some brave muse may sing To ages following,</p>

<p>Upon the Brydale day, which is not long: Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>From those high Towers this noble Lord issuing, Like Radiant Hesper, when his golden hayre In th' Ocean billowes he hath bathed fayre, Descended to the Rivers open vewing, With a great train ensuing. Above the rest were goodly to bee seene Two gentle Knights of lovely face and feature, Beseeming well the bower of anie Queene, With gifts of wit, and ornaments of nature, Fit for so goodly stature,</p>

<p>That like the twins of Jove they seem'd in sight,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Which decke the Bauldricke of the Heavens bright; They two, forth pacing to the Rivers side, Received those two faire Brides, their Loves delight; Which, at th' appointed tyde, Each one did make his Bryde Against their Brydale day, which is not long: Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song.</p>

<p>Epithalamion</p>

<p>Ye learned sisters, which have oftentimes</p>

<p>Beene to me ayding, others to adorne,</p>

<p>Whom ye thought worthy of your gracefull rymes,</p>

<p>That even the greatest did not greatly scorne</p>

<p>To heare theyr names sung in your simple layes,</p>

<p>But joyed in theyr praise;</p>

<p>And when ye list your owne mishaps to mourne,</p>

<p>Which death, or love, or fortunes wreck did rayse,</p>

<p>Your string could soone to sadder tenor turne,</p>

<p>And teach the woods and waters to lament</p>

<p>Your doleful dreriment:</p>

<p>Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside;</p>

<p>And, having all your heads with girlands crownd,</p>

<p>Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound;</p>

<p>Ne let the same of any be en vide:</p>

<p>So Orpheus did for his owne bride!</p>

<p>So I unto my selfe alone will sing;</p>

<p>The woods shall to me answer, and my Eccho ring.</p>

<p>Early, before the worlds light-giving lampe</p>

<p>His golden beame upon the hils doth spred,</p>

<p>Having disperst the nights unchearefull dampe,</p>

<p>Doe ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-hed,</p>

<p>Go to the bowre of my beloved love,</p>

<p>My truest turtle dove;</p>

<p>Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,</p>

<p>And long since ready forth his maske to move,</p>

<p>With his bright Tead that flames with many a flake,</p>

<p>And many a bachelor to waite on him,</p>

<p>In theyr fresh garments trim.</p>

<p>Bid her awake therefore, and soone her dight,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>For lo! the wished day is come at last,</p>

<p>That shall, for all the paynes and sorrowes past,</p>

<p>Pay to her usury of long delight:</p>

<p>And, whylest she doth her dight,</p>

<p>Doe ye to her of joy and solace sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Bring with you all the Nymphes that you can heare Both of the rivers and the forrests greene, And of the sea that neighbours to her neare: Al with gay girlands goodly wel beseene. And let them also with them bring in hand Another gay girland</p>

<p>For my fayre love, of lillyes and of roses,</p>

<p>Bound truelove wize, with a blew silke riband.</p>

<p>And let them make great store of bridale poses,</p>

<p>And let them eeke bring store of other flowers,</p>

<p>To deck the bridale bowers.</p>

<p>And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,</p>

<p>For feare the stones her tender foot should wrong,</p>

<p>Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,</p>

<p>And diapred lyke the discolored mead.</p>

<p>Which done, doe at her chamber dore awayt,</p>

<p>For she will waken strayt;</p>

<p>The whiles doe ye this song unto her sing,</p>

<p>The woods shall to you answer, and your Eccho ring.</p>

<p>Ye Nymphes of Mulla, which with carefull heed The silver scaly trouts doe tend full well, And greedy pikes which use therein to feed: (Those trouts and pikes all others doo excell;) And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake, Where none doo fishes take; Bynd up the locks the which hang scattered light, And in his waters, which your mirror make, Behold your faces as the christall bright, That when you come whereas my love doth lie, No blemish she may spie.</p>

<p>And eke, ye lightfoot mayds, which keep the deere, That on the hoary mountayne used to towre;</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>And the wylde wolves, which seeke them to devoure,</p>

<p>With your steel darts doo chace from coming neer,</p>

<p>Be also present heere,</p>

<p>To helpe to decke her, and to help to sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time;</p>

<p>The Rosy Morne long since left Tithones bed,</p>

<p>All ready to her silver coche to clyme;</p>

<p>And Phoebus gins to shew his glorious hed.</p>

<p>Hark! how the cheereful birds do chaunt theyr laies</p>

<p>And carrol of Loves praise.</p>

<p>The merry Larke hir mattins sings aloft;</p>

<p>The Thrush replyes; the Mavis descant playes;</p>

<p>The Ouzell shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;</p>

<p>So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,</p>

<p>To this dayes merriment.</p>

<p>Ah! my deere love, why doe ye sleepe thus long?</p>

<p>When meeter were that ye should now awake,</p>

<p>T' awayt the comming of your joyous make,</p>

<p>And hearken to the birds love-learned song,</p>

<p>The deawy leaves among!</p>

<p>For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring.</p>

<p>My love is now awake out of her dreames,</p>

<p>And her fayre eyes, like stars that dimmed were</p>

<p>With darksome cloud, now shew theyr goodly beams</p>

<p>More bright then Hesperus his head doth rere.</p>

<p>Come now, ye damzels, daughters of delight,</p>

<p>Helpe quickly her to dight:</p>

<p>But first come ye fayre houres, which were begot</p>

<p>In Joves sweet paradice of Day and Night;</p>

<p>Which doe the seasons of the yeare allot,</p>

<p>And al, that ever in this world is fayre,</p>

<p>Doe make and still repayre:</p>

<p>And ye three handmayds of the Cyprian Queene,</p>

<p>The which doe still adorne her beauties pride,</p>

<p>Helpe to addorne my beautifullest bride:</p>

<p>And, as ye her array, still throw betweene</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER 237</p>

<p>Some graces to be seene;</p>

<p>And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,</p>

<p>The whiles the woods shal answer, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Now is my love all ready forth to come:</p>

<p>Let all the virgins therefore well awayt:</p>

<p>And ye fresh boyes, that tend upon her groome,</p>

<p>Prepare yourselves; for he is comming strayt.</p>

<p>Set all your things in seemely good array,</p>

<p>Fit for so joy full day:</p>

<p>The joyfulst day that ever sunne did see.</p>

<p>Faire Sun! shew forth thy favourable ray,</p>

<p>And let thy lifull heat not fervent be,</p>

<p>For feare of burning her sunshyny face,</p>

<p>Her beauty to disgrace.</p>

<p>O fay rest Phcebus! father of the Muse!</p>

<p>If ever I did honour thee aright,</p>

<p>Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,</p>

<p>Doe not thy servants simple boone refuse;</p>

<p>But let this day, let this one day, be myne;</p>

<p>Let all the rest be thine.</p>

<p>Then I thy soverayne prayses loud wil sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods shal answer, and theyr eccho ring.</p>

<p>Harke! how the Minstrils gin to shrill aloud</p>

<p>Their merry Musick that resounds from far,</p>

<p>The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling Croud,</p>

<p>That well agree withouten breach or jar.</p>

<p>But, most of all, the Damzels doe delite</p>

<p>When they their tymbrels smyte,</p>

<p>And thereunto doe daunce and carrol sweet,</p>

<p>That all the sences they doe ravish quite;</p>

<p>The whyles the boyes run up and downe the street,</p>

<p>Crying aloud with strong confused noyce,</p>

<p>As if it were one voyce,</p>

<p>Hymen, io Hymen, Hymen, they do shout;</p>

<p>That even to the heavens theyr shouting shrill</p>

<p>Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;</p>

<p>To which the people standing all about,</p>

<p>As in approvance, doe thereto applaud,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>And loud advaunce her laud;</p>

<p>And evermore they Hymen, Hymen sing,</p>

<p>That al the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring.</p>

<p>Loe! where she comes along with portly pace,</p>

<p>Lyke Phoebe, from her chamber of the East,</p>

<p>Arysing forth to run her mighty race,</p>

<p>Clad all in white, that seemes a virgin best.</p>

<p>So well it her beseemes, that ye would weene</p>

<p>Some angell she had beene.</p>

<p>Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,</p>

<p>Sprinckled with perle, and perling flowres atweene,</p>

<p>Doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre;</p>

<p>And, being crowned with a girland greene,</p>

<p>Seeme lyke some mayden Queene.</p>

<p>Her modest eyes, abashed to behold</p>

<p>So many gazers as on her do stare,</p>

<p>Upon the lowly ground affixed are;</p>

<p>Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,</p>

<p>But blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,</p>

<p>So farre from being proud.</p>

<p>Nathless doe ye still loud her prayses sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Tell me, ye merchants daughters, did ye see So fayre a creature in your towne before; So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she, Adorned with beautyes grace and vertues store? Her goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining bright, Her forehead yvory white,</p>

<p>Her cheeks lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,</p>

<p>Her lips like cherryes charming men to byte,</p>

<p>Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,</p>

<p>Her paps lyke lyllies budded,</p>

<p>Her snowie neck lyke to a marble towre;</p>

<p>And all her body like a pallace fayre,</p>

<p>Ascending up, with many a stately stayre,</p>

<p>To honours seat and chastities sweet bowre.</p>

<p>Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,</p>

<p>Upon her so to gaze,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER 239</p>

<p>Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,</p>

<p>To which the woods did answer, and your eccho ring?</p>

<p>But if ye saw that which no eyes can see, The inward beauty of her lively spright, Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree, Much more then would ye wonder at that sight, And stand astonisht lyke to those which red Medusaes mazeful hed.</p>

<p>There dwels sweet love, and constant chastity,</p>

<p>Unspotted fayth, and comely womanhood,</p>

<p>Regard of honour, and mild modesty;</p>

<p>There vertue raynes as Queene in royal throne,</p>

<p>And giveth lawes alone,</p>

<p>The which the base affections doe obay,</p>

<p>And yeeld theyr services unto her will;</p>

<p>Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may</p>

<p>Thereto approch to tempt her mind to ill.</p>

<p>Had ye once seene these her celestial threasures,</p>

<p>And unrevealed pleasures,</p>

<p>Then would ye wonder, and her prayses sing,</p>

<p>That al the woods should answer, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Open the temple gates unto my love, Open them wide that she may enter in, And all the postes adorne as doth behove, And all the pillours deck with girlands trim, For to receyve this Saynt with honour dew, That commeth in to you. With trembling steps, and humble reverence, She commeth in, before th' Almighties view; Of her ye virgins learne obedience, When so ye come into those holy places, To humble your proud faces: Bring her up to th' high altar, that she may The sacred ceremonies there partake, The which do endlesse matrimony make; And let the roring Organs loudly play The praises of the Lord in lively notes; The whiles, with hollow throates,</p>

<p>240</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>The Choristers the joyous Antheme sing,</p>

<p>That al the woods may answere, and their eccho ring.</p>

<p>Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,</p>

<p>Hearing the holy priest that to her speakes,</p>

<p>And blesseth her with his two happy hands,</p>

<p>How the red roses flush up in her cheekes,</p>

<p>And the pure snow, with goodly vermill stayne</p>

<p>Like crimsin dyde in grayne:</p>

<p>That even th' Angels, which continually</p>

<p>About the sacred Altare doe remaine,</p>

<p>Forget their service and about her fly,</p>

<p>Ofte peeping in her face, that seems more fayre,</p>

<p>The more they on it stare.</p>

<p>But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,</p>

<p>Are governed with goodly modesty,</p>

<p>That suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,</p>

<p>Which may let in one little thought unsownd.</p>

<p>Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,</p>

<p>The pledge of all our band!</p>

<p>Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluya sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods may answere, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Now al is done: bring home the bride againe;</p>

<p>Bring home the triumph of our victory:</p>

<p>Bring home with you the glory of her gaine</p>

<p>With joyance bring her and with jollity.</p>

<p>Never had man more joy full day then this,</p>

<p>Whom heaven would heape with blis,</p>

<p>Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;</p>

<p>This day for ever to me holy is.</p>

<p>Poure out the wine without restraint or stay,</p>

<p>Poure not by cups, but by the belly full,</p>

<p>Poure out to all that wull,</p>

<p>And sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,</p>

<p>That they may sweat, and drunken be withall.</p>

<p>Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,</p>

<p>And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine;</p>

<p>And let the Graces daunce unto the rest,</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>For they can doo it best:</p>

<p>The whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,</p>

<p>To which the woods shall answer, and theyr eccho ring</p>

<p>Ring ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,</p>

<p>And leave your wonted labors for this day:</p>

<p>This day is holy; doe ye write it downe,</p>

<p>That ye for ever it remember may.</p>

<p>This day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,</p>

<p>With Barnaby the bright,</p>

<p>From whence declining daily by degrees,</p>

<p>He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,</p>

<p>When once the Crab behind his back he sees.</p>

<p>But for this time it ill ordained was,</p>

<p>To chose the longest day in all the yeare,</p>

<p>The shortest night, when longest fitter weare:</p>

<p>Yet never day so long, but late would passe.</p>

<p>Ring ye the bels, to make it weare away,</p>

<p>And bonefiers make all day;</p>

<p>And daunce about them, and about them sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.</p>

<p>Ah! when will this long weary day have end, And lende me leave to come unto my love? How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend? How slowly does sad Time his feathers move? Hast thee, O fayrest Planet, to thy home, Within the Westerne fome: Thy tyred steedes long since have need of rest. Long though it be, at last I see it gloome, And the bright evening-star with golden creast Appeare out of the East. Fayre childe of beauty! glorious lampe of love! That all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead, And guydest lovers through the nights sad dread, How chearefully thou lookest from above, And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light, As joying in the sight</p>

<p>Of these glad many, which for joy doe sing,</p>

<p>That all the woods them answer, and their eccho ring.</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Now ceasse, ye damsels, your delights fore-past;</p>

<p>Enough it is that all the day was youres:</p>

<p>Now day is doen, and night is nighing fast,</p>

<p>Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.</p>

<p>The night is come, now soon her disaray,</p>

<p>And in her bed her lay;</p>

<p>Lay her in lillies and in violets,</p>

<p>And silken courteins over her display,</p>

<p>And odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets,</p>

<p>Behold how goodly my faire love does ly,</p>

<p>In proud humility!</p>

<p>Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took</p>

<p>In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,</p>

<p>Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,</p>

<p>With bathing in the Acidalian brooke.</p>

<p>Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon,</p>

<p>And leave my love alone,</p>

<p>And leave likewise your former lay to sing:</p>

<p>The woods no more shall answere, nor your eccho ring</p>

<p>Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,</p>

<p>That long daies labour doest at last defray,</p>

<p>And all my cares, which cruell Love collected,</p>

<p>Hast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:</p>

<p>Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,</p>

<p>That no man may us see;</p>

<p>And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,</p>

<p>From feare of perrill and foule horror free.</p>

<p>Let no false treason seeke us to entrap,</p>

<p>Nor any dread disquiet once annoy</p>

<p>The safety of our joy;</p>

<p>But let the night be calme, and quietsome,</p>

<p>Without tempestuous storms or sad afray:</p>

<p>Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,</p>

<p>When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:</p>

<p>Or lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie</p>

<p>And begot Majesty.</p>

<p>And let the mayds and yong men cease to sing; Ne let the woods them answer nor theyr eccho ring.</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>243</p>

<p>Let no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares Be heard all night within, nor yet without: Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden feares, Breake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout. Let no deluding dreames, nor dreadfull sights, Make sudden sad affrights;</p>

<p>Ne let house-fyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,</p>

<p>Ne let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,</p>

<p>Ne let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,</p>

<p>Ne let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,</p>

<p>Fray us with things that be not;</p>

<p>Let not the shriech Oule nor the Storke be heard,</p>

<p>Nor the night Raven, that still deadly yels:</p>

<p>Nor dammed ghosts, cald up with mighty spels,</p>

<p>Nor griesly vultures, make us once affeard:</p>

<p>Ne let th' unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking</p>

<p>Make us to wish theyr choking.</p>

<p>Let none of these theyr drery accents sing;</p>

<p>Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.</p>

<p>But still let Silence trew night-watches keepe,</p>

<p>That sacred Peace may in assurance rayne,</p>

<p>And tymely Sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,</p>

<p>May poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne;</p>

<p>The whiles an hundred little winged loves,</p>

<p>Like divers-fethered doves,</p>

<p>Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,</p>

<p>And in the secret darke, that none reproves,</p>

<p>Their prety stealthes shal worke, and snares shal spread</p>

<p>To filch away sweet snatches of delight,</p>

<p>Conceald through covert night.</p>

<p>Ye sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will!</p>

<p>For greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,</p>

<p>Thinks more upon her paradise of joyes,</p>

<p>Then what ye do, albe it good or ill.</p>

<p>All night therefore attend your merry play,</p>

<p>For it will soone be day:</p>

<p>Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing;</p>

<p>Ne will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Who is the same, which at my window peepes? Or whose is that faire face that shines so bright? Is it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes, But walkes about high heaven al the night? O! fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy My love with me to spy:</p>

<p>For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought</p>

<p>And for a fleece of wooll, which privily</p>

<p>The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought,</p>

<p>His pleasures with thee wrought.</p>

<p>Therefore to us be favourable now;</p>

<p>And sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,</p>

<p>And generation goodly dost enlarge,</p>

<p>Encline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,</p>

<p>And the chaste wombe informe with timely seed,</p>

<p>That may our comfort breed:</p>

<p>Till which we cease our hopefull hap to sing;</p>

<p>Ne let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.</p>

<p>And thou, great Juno! which with awful might The lawes of wedlock still dost patronize; And the religion of the faith first plight With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize; And eeke for comfort often called art Of women in their smart; Eternally bind thou this lovely band, And all thy blessings unto us impart. And thou, glad Genius! in whose gende hand The bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine, Without blemish or staine; And the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight With secret ayde doest succor and supply, Till they bring forth the fruitfull progeny; Send us the timely fruit of this same night. And thou, fayre Hebe! and thou, Hymen free! Grant that it may so be.</p>

<p>Till which we cease your further prayse to sing; Ne any woods shall answer, nor your Eccho ring.</p>

<p>And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods, In which a thousand torches flaming bright</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Doe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods</p>

<p>In dreadful darknesse lend desired light;</p>

<p>And all ye powers which in the same remayne,</p>

<p>More then we men can fayne!</p>

<p>Poure out your blessing on us plentiously,</p>

<p>And happy influence upon us raine,</p>

<p>That we may raise a large posterity,</p>

<p>Which from the earth, which they may long possesse</p>

<p>With lasting happinesse,</p>

<p>Up to your haughty pallaces may mount;</p>

<p>And for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit,</p>

<p>May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,</p>

<p>Of blessed Saints for to increase the count.</p>

<p>So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,</p>

<p>And cease till then our tymely joyes to sing:</p>

<p>The woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring!</p>

<p>Song! made in lieu of many ornaments,</p>

<p>With which my love should duly have been dect,</p>

<p>Which cutting off through hasty accidents,</p>

<p>Ye would not stay your dew time to expect,</p>

<p>But promist both to recompens;</p>

<p>Be unto her a goodly ornament,</p>

<p>And for short time an endlesse moniment.</p>

<p>A Ditty</p>

<p>In praise of Eliza, Queen of the Shepherds</p>

<p>See where she sits upon the grassie greene,</p>

<p>(O seemely sight!) Yclad in Scarlot, like a mayden Queene,</p>

<p>And ermines white: Upon her head a Cremosin coronet With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:</p>

<p>Bay leaves betweene,</p>

<p>And primroses greene, Embellish the sweete Violet.</p>

<p>Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face Like Phoebe fayre?</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace,</p>

<p>Can you well compare? The Redde rose medled with the White yfere, In either cheeke depeincten lively chere:</p>

<p>Her modest eye,</p>

<p>Her Majestie, Where have you seene the like but there?</p>

<p>I see Calliope speede her to the place,</p>

<p>Where my Goddesse shines; And after her the other Muses trace</p>

<p>With their Violines. Bene they not Bay braunches which they do beare, All for Elisa in her hand to weare?</p>

<p>So sweetely they play,</p>

<p>And sing all the way, That it a heaven is to heare.</p>

<p>Lo, how finely the Graces can it foote</p>

<p>To the Instrument: They dauncen defny, and singen soote,</p>

<p>In their meriment. Wants not a fourth Grace to make the daunce even Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven.</p>

<p>She shal be a Grace,</p>

<p>To fyll the fourth place, And reigne with the rest in heaven.</p>

<p>Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,</p>

<p>With Gelliflowres; Bring Coronations, and Sops-in-wine</p>

<p>Worne of Paramoures: Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies, And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:</p>

<p>The pretie Pawnee,</p>

<p>And the Chevisaunce, Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.</p>

<p>Now ryse up, Elisa, decked as thou art In royall aray;</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>And now ye daintie Damsells may depart Eche one her way.</p>

<p>I feare I have troubled your troupes to longe</p>

<p>Let dame Elisa thanke you for her song: And if you come hether When Damsines I gether,</p>

<p>I will part them all you among.</p>

<p>Perigot and Willie's Roundelay</p>

<p>It fell upon a holly eve,</p>

<p>Hey ho, hollidaye! When holly fathers wont to shrieve,</p>

<p>Now gynneth this roundelay. Sitting upon a hill so hye,</p>

<p>Hey ho, the high hyll! The while my flocke did feede thereby,</p>

<p>The while the shepheard selfe did spill:</p>

<p>I saw the bouncing Bellibone,</p>

<p>Hey ho, Bonibell! Tripping over the dale alone:</p>

<p>She can trippe it very well; Well decked in a frocke of gray,</p>

<p>Hey ho, gray is greete! And in a kirtle of greene saye,</p>

<p>The greene is for maydens meete.</p>

<p>A chapelet on her head she wore,</p>

<p>Hey ho, chapelet! Of sweete violets therein was store,</p>

<p>She sweeter then the violet. My sheepe did leave theyr wonted foode,</p>

<p>Hey ho, seely sheepe! And gazd on her, as they were wood,</p>

<p>Woode as he, that did them keepe.</p>

<p>As the bonnilasse passed bye,</p>

<p>Hey ho, bonilasse! She rovde at me with glauncing eye,</p>

<p>As cleare as the christall glasse:</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>All as the sunnye beame so bright,</p>

<p>Hey ho, the sunne beame! Glaunceth from Phcebus face forthright,</p>

<p>So love into my hart did streame:</p>

<p>Or as the thonder cleaves the cloudes,</p>

<p>Hey ho, the thonder! Wherein the lightsome levin shroudes,</p>

<p>So cleaves thy soule asonder: Or as Dame Cynthias silver raye</p>

<p>Hey ho, the moonelight! Upon the glyttering wave doth playe:</p>

<p>Such play is a pitteous plight!</p>

<p>The glaunce into my heart did glide,</p>

<p>Hey ho, the glyder! Therewith my soule was sharply gryde;</p>

<p>Such woundes soone wexen wider. Hasting to raunch the arrow out,</p>

<p>Hey ho, Perigot! I left the head in my hart roote:</p>

<p>It was a desperate shot.</p>

<p>There it ranckleth ay more and more,</p>

<p>Hey ho, the arrowe! Ne can I find salve for my sore:</p>

<p>Love is a cureless sorrowe. And though my bale with death I brought,</p>

<p>Hey ho, heavie cheere! Yet should thilk lasse not from my thought</p>

<p>So you may buye gold to deare.</p>

<p>But whether in paynefull love I pyne,</p>

<p>Hey ho, pinching payne! Or thrive in welth, she shalbe mine.</p>

<p>But if thou can her obteine. And if for gracelesse griefe I dye,</p>

<p>Hey ho, graceless griefe! Witnesse, shee slewe me with her eye:</p>

<p>Let thy follye be the priefe.</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>And you that sawe it, simple shepe,</p>

<p>Hey ho, the fayre flocke! For priefe thereof my death shall weepe,</p>

<p>And mone with many a mocke. So learnd I love on a hollye eve,</p>

<p>Hey ho, holidaye! That ever since my hart did greve:</p>

<p>Now endeth our roundelay.</p>

<p>Easter</p>

<p>Most glorious Lord of Lyfe! that, on this day, Didst make Thy triumph over death and sin; And, having harrowd hell, didst bring away Captivity thence captive, us to win: This joyous day, deare Lord, with joy begin; And grant that we, for whom thou diddest dye, Being with Thy deare blood clene washt from sin, May live for ever in felicity! And that Thy love we weighing worthily, May likewise love Thee for the same againe; And for Thy sake, that all lyke deare didst buy, With love may one another entertayne!</p>

<p>So let us love, deare Love, lyke as we ought, Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.</p>

<p>What Guile Is This ?</p>

<p>What guile is this, that those her golden tresses She doth attire under a net of gold; And with sly skill so cunningly them dresses, That which is gold or hair may scarce be told? Is it that men's frail eyes, which gaze too bold, She may entangle in that golden snare; And, being caught, may craftily enfold Their weaker hearts, which are not well aware? Take heed, therefore, mine eyes, how ye do stare Henceforth too rashly on that guileful net, In which, if ever ye entrapped are, Out of her bands ye by no means shall get. Fondness it were for any, being free, To cover fetters, though they golden be.</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>Fair Is My Love</p>

<p>Fair is my love, when her fair golden hairs With the loose wind ye waving chance to mark; Fair, when the rose in her red cheeks appears; Or in her eyes the fire of love does spark. Fair, when her breast, like a rich-laden bark, With precious merchandise she forth doth lay; Fair, when that cloud of pride, which oft doth dark Her goodly light, with smiles she drives away. But fairest she, when so she doth display The gate with pearls and rubies richly dight; Through which her words so wise do make their wa; To bear the message of her gende sprite.</p>

<p>The rest be works of nature's wonderment: But this the work of heart's astonishment.</p>

<p>So Oft as I Her Beauty do Behold</p>

<p>So oft as I her beauty do behold,</p>

<p>And therewith do her cruelty compare,</p>

<p>I marvel of what substance was the mould,</p>

<p>The which her made at once so cruel fair,</p>

<p>Not earth, for her high thoughts more heavenly are</p>

<p>Not water, for her love doth burn like fire;</p>

<p>Not air, for she is not so light or rare;</p>

<p>Not fire, for she doth freeze with faint desire.</p>

<p>Then needs another element inquire</p>

<p>Whereof she mote be madethat is, the sky;</p>

<p>For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire,</p>

<p>And eke her mind is pure immortal high.</p>

<p>Then, sith to heaven ye likened are the best,</p>

<p>Be like in mercy as in all the rest.</p>

<p>Rudely Thou Wrongest My Dear Heart's Desire</p>

<p>Rudely thou wrongest my dear heart's desire, In finding fault with her too portly pride: The thing which I do most in her admire, Is of the world unworthy most envied;</p>

<p>EDMUND SPENSER</p>

<p>For in those lofty looks is close implied Scorn of base things, and 'sdain of foul dishonour, Threatening rash eyes which gaze on her so wide, That loosely they ne dare to look upon her. Such pride is praise, such portliness is honour, That boldened innocence bears in her eyes; And her fair countenance, like a goodly banner, Spreads in defiance of all enemies. Was never in this world aught worthy tried, Without some spark of such self-pleasing pride.</p>

<p>One Day I Wrote Her Name Upon the Strand</p>

<p>One day I wrote her name upon the strand, But came the waves and washed it away: Again I wrote it with a second hand, But came the tide and made my pains his prey. Vain man (said she) that dost in vain assay A mortal thing so to immortalise; For I myself shall like to this decay, And eke my name be wiped out likewise. Not so (quod I); let baser things devise To die in dust, but you shall live by fame; My verse your virtues rare shall eternise, And in the heavens write your glorious name: Where, when as Death shall all the world subdue, Our love shall live, and later life renew.</p>

<p>Like as the Culver, on the Bared Bough</p>

<p>Like as the culver, on the bared bough, Sits mourning for the absence of her mate; And, in her songs, sends many a wishful vow For his return that seems to linger late: So I alone, now left disconsolate, Mourn to myself the absence of my love; And, wandering here and there all desolate, Seek with my plaints to match that mournful dove Ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove, Can comfort me, but her own joyous sight</p>

<p>WILLIAM HABINGTON</p>

<p>Whose sweet aspect both God and man can move, In her unspotted pleasance to delight. Dark is my day, whiles her fair light I miss, And dead my life that wants such lively bliss.</p>

<p>WILLIAM HABINGTON [1605-1654]</p>

<p>To Roses in the Bosom of Castara</p>

<p>Ye blushing virgins happy are</p>

<p>In the chaste nunnery of her breasts</p>

<p>For he'd profane so chaste a fair,</p>

<p>Whoe'er should call them Cupid's nests.</p>

<p>Transplanted thus how bright ye grow!</p>

<p>How rich a perfume do ye yield! In some close garden cowslips so</p>

<p>Are sweeter than i' th' open field.</p>

<p>In those white cloisters live secure</p>

<p>From the rude blasts of wanton breathl</p>

<p>Each hour more innocent and pure, Till you shall wither into death.</p>

<p>Then that which living gave you room, Your glorious sepulchre shall be.</p>

<p>There wants no marble for a tomb Whose breast hath marble been to me.</p>

<p>Nox Nocti Indicat Scientiam</p>

<p>When I survey the bright</p>

<p>Celestial sphere; So rich with jewels hung, that Night</p>

<p>Doth like an Ethiop bride appear:</p>

<p>My soul her wings doth spread And heavenward flies, Th' Almighty's mysteries to read In the large volume of the skies.</p>

<p>WILLIAM HABINGTON</p>

<p>For the bright firmament Shoots forth no flame So silent, but is eloquent In speaking the Creator's name.</p>

<p>No unregarded star Contracts its light Into so small a character,</p>

<p>Removed far from our human sight,</p>

<p>But if we steadfast look We shall discern In it, as in some holy book, How man may heavenly knowledge learn.</p>

<p>It tells the conqueror That far-stretch'd power, Which his proud dangers traffic for, Is but the triumph of an hour:</p>

<p>That from the farthest North, Some nation may, Yet undiscover'd, issue forth, And o'er his new-got conquest sway:</p>

<p>Some nation yet shut in With hills of ice May be let out to scourge his sin, Till they shall equal him in vice.</p>

<p>And then they likewise shall Their ruin have; For as yourselves your empires fall, And every kingdom hath a grave.</p>

<p>Thus those celestial fires, Though seeming mute, The fallacy of our desires And all the pride of life confute:</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE</p>

<p>For they have watch'd since first The World had birth: And found sin in itself accurst, And nothing permanent on Earth.</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE [1564-1593]</p>

<p>The Passionate Shepherd to His Love</p>

<p>Come live with me and be my Love, And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys, dales and field, Or woods or steepy mountain yields.</p>

<p>And we will sit upon the rocks And see the shepherds feed their flocks, By shallow rivers, to whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals.</p>

<p>And I will make thee beds of roses And a thousand fragrant posies, A cap of flowers, and a kirtle Embroider'd all with leaves of myrde.</p>

<p>A gown made of the finest wool, Which from our pretty lambs we pull, Fair lined slippers for the cold, With buckles of the purest gold.</p>

<p>A belt of straw and ivy buds With coral clasps and amber studs: And if these pleasures may thee move, Come live with me and be my Love.</p>

<p>Thy silver dishes for thy meat As precious as the gods do eat, Shall on an ivory table be Prepared each day for thee and me.</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE</p>

<p>The shepherd swains shall dance and sing For thy delight each May-morning: If these delights thy mind may move, Then live with me and be my Love.</p>

<p>Her Reply</p>

<p>(Written by Sir Walter Raleigh)</p>

<p>If all the world and love were young, And truth in every shepherd's tongue, These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee and be thy Love.</p>

<p>But Time drives flocks from field to fold; When rivers rage and rocks grow cold; And Philomel becometh dumb; The rest complains of cares to come.</p>

<p>The flowers do fade, and wanton fields To wayward Winter reckoning yields: A honey tongue, a heart of gall, Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.</p>

<p>Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses, Thy cap, thy kirde, and thy posies, Soon break, soon withersoon fargotten, In folly ripe, in reason rotten.</p>

<p>Thy belt of straw and ivy-buds, Thy coral clasps and amber studs, All these in me no means can move To come to thee and be thy Love.</p>

<p>But could youth last, and love still breed, Had joys no date, nor age no need, Then these delights my mind might move To live with thee and be thy Love.</p>

<p>In Time of Pestilence</p>

<p>Adieu, farewell earth's bliss! This world uncertain is: Fond are life's lustful joys, Death proves them all but toys. None from his darts can fly; I am sick, I must die</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on usl</p>

<p>Rich men, trust not in wealth, Gold cannot buy you health; Physic himself must fade; All things to end are made; The plague full swift goes by; I am sick, I must die</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on usl</p>

<p>Beauty is but a flower Which wrinkles will devour; Brightness falls from the air; Queens have died young and fair; Dust hath closed Helen's eye; I am sick, I must die</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on usl</p>

<p>Strength stoops unto the grave, Worms feed on Hector brave; Swords may not fight with fate; Earth still holds ope her gate;</p>

<p>THOMAS NASHE</p>

<p>Come, cornel the bells do cry; I am sick, I must die</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on usl</p>

<p>Wit with his wantonness Tasteth death's bitterness; Hell's executioner Hath no ears for to hear What vain art can reply: I am sick, I must die</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on usl</p>

<p>Haste therefore each degree To welcome destiny; Heaven is our heritage, Earth but a player's stage. Mount we unto the sky; I am sick, I must die</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on usl</p>

<p>Spring</p>

<p>Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant king; Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing, Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!</p>

<p>The palm and may make country houses gay, Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day, And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay, Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!</p>

<p>The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet, Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit, In every street these tunes our ears do greet, Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo! Spring! the sweet Spring!</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE [7564-/6/6]</p>

<p>Winter</p>

<p>When icicles hang by the wall And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,</p>

<p>And Tom bears logs into the hall,</p>

<p>And milk comes frozen home in pail;</p>

<p>When blood is nipt, and ways be foul,</p>

<p>Then nighdy sings the staring owl Tu-whoo!</p>

<p>To-whit, Tu-whoo! A merry note!</p>

<p>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</p>

<p>When all about the wind doth blow, And coughing drowns the parson's saw,</p>

<p>And birds sit brooding in the snow,</p>

<p>And Marian's nose looks red and raw;</p>

<p>When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl</p>

<p>Then nightly sings the staring owl Tu-whoo!</p>

<p>To-whit, Tu-whoo! A merry note!</p>

<p>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</p>

<p>O Mistress Mine</p>

<p>O Mistress mine, where are you roaming? O stay and hear! your true-love's coming</p>

<p>That can sing both high and low; Trip no further, pretty sweeting, Journeys end in lovers' meeting</p>

<p>Every wise man's son doth know.</p>

<p>What is love? 'tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughter;</p>

<p>What's to come is still unsure: In delay there lies no plenty, Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty,</p>

<p>Youth's a stuff will not endure.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Fancy</p>

<p>Tell me where is Fancy bred, Or in the heart, or in the head? How begot, how nourished? Reply, reply.</p>

<p>It is engender'd in the eyes; With gazing fed; and Fancy dies In the cradle where it lies: Let us all ring Fancy's knell; I'll begin it,Ding, dong, bell.</p>

<p>Ding, dong, bell.</p>

<p>Under the Greenwood Tree Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me, And tune his merry note Unto the sweet bird's throat Come hither, come hither, come hither! Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather.</p>

<p>Who doth ambition shun And loves to live i' the sun, Seeking the food he eats</p>

<p>And pleased with what he gets Come hither, come hither, come hither! Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather.</p>

<p>A Lover and His Lass</p>

<p>It was a lover and his lass</p>

<p>With a hey and a ho, and a hey-nonino! That o'er the green corn-field did pass In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, When birds do sing hey ding a ding:</p>

<p>Sweet lovers love the Spring.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Between the acres of the rye These pretty country folks would lie: This carol they began that hour, How that life was but a flower:</p>

<p>And therefore take the present time</p>

<p>With a hey and a ho, and a hey-nonino! For love is crowned with the prime In the spring time, the only pretty ring time, When birds do sing hey ding a ding: Sweet lovers love the Spring.</p>

<p>Silvia</p>

<p>Who is Silvia?  What is she?</p>

<p>That all our swains commend her? Holy, fair, and wise is she:</p>

<p>The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admired be.</p>

<p>Is she kind as she is fair?</p>

<p>For beauty lives with kindness: Love doth to her eyes repair,</p>

<p>To help him of his blindness; And, being help'd, inhabits there.</p>

<p>Then to Silvia let us sing,</p>

<p>That Silvia is excelling; She excels each mortal thing</p>

<p>Upon the dull earth dwelling: To her let us garlands bring.</p>

<p>Spring</p>

<p>When daisies pied and violets blue,</p>

<p>And lady-smocks all silver-white, ,</p>

<p>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue Do paint the meadows with delight,</p>

<p>The cuckoo then, on every tree,</p>

<p>Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo!</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo!O word of fear, Unpleasing to a married ear!</p>

<p>When shepherds pipe on oaten straws, And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,</p>

<p>When turdes tread, and rooks, and daws, And maidens bleach their summer smocks,</p>

<p>The cuckoo then, on every tree,</p>

<p>Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo!</p>

<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo!O word of fear, Unpleasing to a married ear!</p>

<p>Lullaby</p>

<p>You spotted snakes with double tongue, Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;</p>

<p>Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong; Come not near our fairy queen.</p>

<p>Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby; Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby!</p>

<p>Never harm,</p>

<p>Nor spell nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh; So, good night, with lullaby.</p>

<p>Weaving spiders, come not here;</p>

<p>Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence! Beedes black, approach not near;</p>

<p>Worm nor snail, do no offence.</p>

<p>Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby; Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby!</p>

<p>Never harm,</p>

<p>Nor spell nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh; So, good night, with lullaby.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Ophelia's Song</p>

<p>How should I your true love know</p>

<p>From another one? By his cockle hat and staff,</p>

<p>And his sandal shoon.</p>

<p>He is dead and gone, lady,</p>

<p>He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf,</p>

<p>At his heels a stone.</p>

<p>White his shroud as the mountain snow,</p>

<p>Larded with sweet flowers, Which bewept to the grave did go</p>

<p>With true-love showers.</p>

<p>Where the Bee Sucks</p>

<p>Where the bee sucks, there suck I: In a cowslip's bell I lie;</p>

<p>There I couch when owls do cry.</p>

<p>On the bat's back I do fly.</p>

<p>After summer merrily:</p>

<p>Merrily, merrily, shall I live now</p>

<p>Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.</p>

<p>Love's Perjuries</p>

<p>On a day, alack the day! Love, whose month is ever May, Spied a blossom passing fair Playing in the wanton air; Through the velvet leaves the wind, All unseen, 'gan passage find; That the lover, sick to death, Wish'd himself the heaven's breath. Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow; Air, would I might triumph so! But, alack, my hand is sworn Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Vow, alack, for youth unmeet;</p>

<p>Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.</p>

<p>Do not call it sin in me</p>

<p>That I am forsworn for thee:</p>

<p>Thou for whom e'en Jove would swear</p>

<p>Juno but an Ethiope were,</p>

<p>And deny himself for Jove,</p>

<p>Turning mortal for thy love.</p>

<p>Take, O Take Take, O take those lips away That so sweetly were forsworn, And those eyes, the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn: But my kisses bring again,</p>

<p>Bring again Seals of love, but seal'd in vain,</p>

<p>Seal'd in vain!</p>

<p>A Madrigal</p>

<p>Crabbed Age and Youth</p>

<p>Cannot live together:</p>

<p>Youth is full of pleasance,</p>

<p>Age is full of care;</p>

<p>Youth like summer morn,</p>

<p>Age like winter weather,</p>

<p>Youth like summer brave,</p>

<p>Age like winter bare:</p>

<p>Youth is full of sport,</p>

<p>Age's breath is short,</p>

<p>Youth is nimble, Age is lame:</p>

<p>Youth is hot and bold,</p>

<p>Age is weak and cold,</p>

<p>Youth is wild, and Age is tame:</p>

<p>Age, I do abhor thee,</p>

<p>Youth, I do adore thee;</p>

<p>O! my Love, my Love is young!</p>

<p>Age, I do defy thee</p>

<p>O sweet shepherd, hie thee,</p>

<p>For methinks thou stay'st too long.</p>

<p>268</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>w; Amiens' Song</p>

<p>Blow, blow, thou winter wind,</p>

<p>Thou art not so unkind</p>

<p>As man's ingratitude;</p>

<p>Thy tooth is not so keen</p>

<p>Because thou art not seen,</p>

<p>Although thy breath be rude. Heigh ho! sing heigh ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:</p>

<p>Then, heigh ho! the holly!</p>

<p>This life is most jolly.</p>

<p>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</p>

<p>Thou dost not bite so nigh</p>

<p>As benefits forgot:</p>

<p>Though thou the waters warp,</p>

<p>Thy sting is not so sharp</p>

<p>As friend remember'd not. Heigh ho! sing heigh ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:</p>

<p>Then, heigh ho! the holly!</p>

<p>This life is most jolly.</p>

<p>104 Dawn Song</p>

<p>Hark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,</p>

<p>And Phoebus 'gins arise, His steeds to water at those springs</p>

<p>On chaliced flowers that lies; And winking Mary-buds begin</p>

<p>To ope their golden eyes: With everything that pretty bin,</p>

<p>My lady sweet, arise! Arise, arise!</p>

<p>/05 Dirge of Love</p>

<p>Come away, come away, Death, And in sad cypres let me be laid;</p>

<p>Fly away, fly away, breath; I am slain by a fair cruel maid.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,</p>

<p>O prepare it! My part of death no one so true</p>

<p>Did share it.</p>

<p>Not a flower, not a flower sweet On my black coffin let there be strown;</p>

<p>Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown; A thousand thousand sighs to save,</p>

<p>Lay me, O where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there.</p>

<p>Fidele's Dirge</p>

<p>Fear no more the heat o' the sun Nor the furious winter's rages;</p>

<p>Thou thy worldly task hast done,</p>

<p>Home art gone and ta'en thy wages:</p>

<p>Golden lads and girls all must,</p>

<p>As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.</p>

<p>Fear no more the frown o' the great, Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;</p>

<p>Care no more to clothe and eat; To thee the reed is as the oak:</p>

<p>The sceptre, learning, physic, must</p>

<p>All follow this, and come to dust.</p>

<p>Fear no more the lightning-flash</p>

<p>Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;</p>

<p>Fear not slander, censure rash;</p>

<p>Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:</p>

<p>All lovers young, all lovers must</p>

<p>Consign to thee, and come to dust.</p>

<p>No exorciser harm thee!</p>

<p>Nor no witchcraft charm thee! Ghost unlaid forbear thee!</p>

<p>Nothing ill come near thee! Quiet consummation have; And renowned be thy grave!</p>

<p>270 WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>ioj A Sea Dirge</p>

<p>Full fathom five thy father lies: Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes: Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: Hark! now I hear them, Ding, dong, bell.</p>

<p>108 Eighteenth Sonnet</p>

<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate; Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd: And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd. But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade When in eternal lines to time thou growest. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>

<p>109 Twenty-ninth Sonnet</p>

<p>When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate; Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featured like him, like him with friends possest, Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on theeand then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 1JI</p>

<p>From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remember'd, such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>

<p>no Thirtieth Sonnet</p>

<p>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</p>

<p>I summon up remembrance of things past,</p>

<p>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</p>

<p>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste;</p>

<p>Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,</p>

<p>For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</p>

<p>And weep afresh love's long-since cancell'd woe,</p>

<p>And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight.</p>

<p>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</p>

<p>And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</p>

<p>The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</p>

<p>Which I new pay as if not paid before:</p>

<p>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, All losses are restored, and sorrows end.</p>

<p>7// Thirty-first Sonnet</p>

<p>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts Which I, by lacking, have supposed dead: And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts, And all those friends which I thought buried. How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye, As interest of the dead!which now appear But things removed that hidden in thee lie. Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, Who all their parts of me to thee did give; That due of many now is thine alone: Their images I loved I view in thee, And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.</p>

<p>772 Thirty-second Sonnet</p>

<p>If thou survive my well-contented day</p>

<p>When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,</p>

<p>And shalt by fortune once more re-survey</p>

<p>272 WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover; Compare them with the bettering of the time, And though they be outstripp'd by every pen, Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme Exceeded by the height of happier men. O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought 'Had my friend's muse grown with this growing age, A dearer birth than this his love had brought, To march in ranks of better equipage: But since he died, and poets better prove, Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'</p>

<p>1/3 Thirty-third Sonnet</p>

<p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, Kissing with golden face the meadows green, Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; Anon permit the basest clouds to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face, And from the forlorn world his visage hide, Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: Even so my sun one early morn did shine With all-triumphant splendour on my brow; But out, alack! he was but one hour mine; The region-cloud hath mask'd him from me now.</p>

<p>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;</p>

<p>Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.</p>

<p>114 Fifty-fourth Sonnet</p>

<p>O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give! The Rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live. The Canker-blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the Roses, Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly When summer's breath their masked buds discloses; Butfor their virtue only is their show</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 273</p>

<p>They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade, Die to themselves.   Sweet Roses do not so; Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made. And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, When that shall fade, my verse distils your truth.</p>

<p>775 Fifty-fifth Sonnet</p>

<p>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments Of princes, shall oudive this powerful rhyme; But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time. When wasteful war shall statues overturn, And broils root out the work of masonry, Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory. 'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom. So, till the judgment that yourself arise, You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</p>

<p>//6 Fifty-seventh Sonnet</p>

<p>Being your slave, what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do, till you require: Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you, Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu: Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be, or your affairs suppose, But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought Save, where you are, how happy you make those. So true a fool is love, that in your will, Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Sixtieth Sonnet</p>

<p>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore So do our minutes hasten to their end; Each changing place with that which goes before, In sequent toil all forwards do contend. Nativity once in the main of light, Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd, Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight, And Time, that gave, doth now his gift confound. Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, And delves the parallels in beauty's brow; Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow: And yet, to times in hope, my verse shall stand Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</p>

<p>Sixty-fourth Sonnet</p>

<p>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age; When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed, And brass eternal, slave to mortal rage; When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, And the firm soil win of the watery main, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store; When I have seen such interchange of state, Or state itself confounded to decay, Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my Love away: This thought is as a death, which cannot choose But weep to have that which it fears to lose.</p>

<p>Sixty-fifth Sonnet</p>

<p>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, But sad mortality o'ersways their power, How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, Whose action is no stronger than a flower? O how shall summer's honey breath hold out Against the wreckful siege of battering days,</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 275</p>

<p>When rocks impregnable are not so stout</p>

<p>Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?</p>

<p>O fearful meditation! where, alack!</p>

<p>Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?</p>

<p>Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,</p>

<p>Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? O none, unless this miracle have might, That in black ink my love may still shine bright.</p>

<p>/20 Sixty-sixth Sonnet</p>

<p>Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,</p>

<p>As, to behold desert a beggar born,</p>

<p>And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,</p>

<p>And purest faith unhappily forsworn,</p>

<p>And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,</p>

<p>And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,</p>

<p>And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,</p>

<p>And strength by limping sway disabled,</p>

<p>And art made tongue-tied by authority,</p>

<p>And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,</p>

<p>And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,</p>

<p>And captive Good attending captain 111:</p>

<p>Tired with all these, from these would I be gone, Save that, to die, I leave my Love alone.</p>

<p>727 Seventy-first Sonnet</p>

<p>No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world, that I am fled From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell; Nay, if you read this line, remember not The hand that writ it; for I love you so, That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe. O, if, I say, you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay, Do not so much as my poor name rehearse, But let your love even with my life decay, Lest the wise world should look into your moan, And mock you with me after I am gone.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Seventy-third Sonnet</p>

<p>That time of year thou may'st in me behold When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang: In me thou see'st the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west, Which by and by black night doth take away, Death's second self, that seals up all in rest: In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, That on the ashes of his youth doth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire, Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by: This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,</p>

<p>To love that well which thou must leave ere long.</p>

<p>Eighty-seventh Sonnet</p>

<p>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</p>

<p>And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:</p>

<p>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</p>

<p>My bonds in thee are all determinate.</p>

<p>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</p>

<p>And for that riches where is my deserving?</p>

<p>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</p>

<p>And so my patent back again is swerving.</p>

<p>Thyself thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,</p>

<p>Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;</p>

<p>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,</p>

<p>Comes home again, on better judgment making.</p>

<p>Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter;</p>

<p>In sleep, a king; but waking, no such matter.</p>

<p>Ninetieth Sonnet</p>

<p>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now; Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross, Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, And do not drop in for an after-loss:</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 277</p>

<p>Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow, Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe; Give not a windy night a rainy morrow, To linger out a purposed overthrow. If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, When other petty griefs have done their spite, But in the onset come: so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortune's might; And other strains of woe, which now seem woe, Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.</p>

<p>725 Ninety-fourth Sonnet</p>

<p>They that have power to hurt, and will do none, That do not do the thing they most do show, Who, moving others, are themselves as stone, Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow, They rightly do inherit Heaven's graces, And husband nature's riches from expense; They are the lords and owners of their faces, Others, but stewards of their excellence. The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself it only live and die; But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</p>

<p>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;</p>

<p>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.</p>

<p>726 Ninety-seventh Sonnet</p>

<p>How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen, What old December's bareness everywhere! And yet this time removed was summer's time; The teeming autumn, big with rich increase, Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease: Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit; For summer and his pleasures wait on thee, And, thou away, the very birds are mute;</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,</p>

<p>That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.</p>

<p>Ninety-eighth Sonnet</p>

<p>From you have I been absent in the spring, When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim, Hath put a spirit of youth in everything, That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him. Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue, Could make me any summer's story tell, Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew; Nor did I wonder at the Lily's white, Nor praise the deep vermilion in the Rose; They were but sweet, but figures of delight, Drawn after you, you pattern of all those. Yet seem'd it Winter still, and you, away, As with your shadow I with these did play.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Fourth Sonnet</p>

<p>To me, fair friend, you never can be old, For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers' pride; Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd In process of the seasons have I seen, Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd, Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived; So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived: For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred, Ere you were born, was beauty's summer dead.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Sixth Sonnet</p>

<p>When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights, And beauty making beautiful old rhyme</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights; Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, I see their antique pen would have exprest Ev'n such a beauty as you master now. So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time, all, you prefiguring; And for they look'd but with divining eyes, They had not skill enough your worth to sing: For we, which now behold these present days, Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Seventh Sonnet</p>

<p>Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, Can yet the lease of my true love control, Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom. The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd And the sad augurs mock their own presage; Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd And peace proclaims olives of endless age. Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes, Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme, While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes: And thou in this shalt find thy monument, When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Ninth Sonnet</p>

<p>O, never say that I was false of heart,</p>

<p>Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify:</p>

<p>As easy might I from myself depart</p>

<p>As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie;</p>

<p>That is my home of love; if I have ranged,</p>

<p>Like him that travels, I return again,</p>

<p>Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,</p>

<p>So that myself bring water for my stain.</p>

<p>Never believe, though in my nature reign'd</p>

<p>All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,</p>

<p>280</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>That it could so preposterously be stain'd, To leave for nothing all thy sum of good: For nothing this wide universe I call, Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.</p>

<p>132 One Hundred and Tenth Sonnet</p>

<p>Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there</p>

<p>And made myself a motley to the view,</p>

<p>Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</p>

<p>Made old offences of affections new;</p>

<p>Most true it is that I have look'd on truth</p>

<p>Askance and strangely: but, by all above,</p>

<p>These blenches gave my heart another youth,</p>

<p>And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.</p>

<p>Now all is done, have what shall have no end:</p>

<p>Mine appetite I never more will grind</p>

<p>On newer proof, to try an older friend,</p>

<p>A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.</p>

<p>Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Eleventh Sonnet</p>

<p>O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide, The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, That did not better for my life provide Than public means, which public manners breeds. Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, And almost thence my nature is subdu'd To what it works in, like the dyer's hand. Pity me then and wish I were renew'd; Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; No bitterness that I will bitter think, Nor double penance, to correct correction. Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me.</p>

<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>281</p>

<p>134 One Hundred and Sixteenth Sonnet</p>

<p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests, and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out ev'n to the edge of doom: If this be error, and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>

<p>/J5 One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Sonnet</p>

<p>Th' expense of Spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action; and till action, lust Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame, Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight; Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had, Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad: Mad in pursuit, and in possession so; Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe; Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream. All this the world well knows; yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</p>

<p>136 One Hundred and Forty-sixth Sonnet</p>

<p>Poor Soul, the centre of my sinful earth, Fool'd by these rebel powers that thee array, Why dost thou pine within, and suffer dearth, Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? Why so large cost, having so short a lease,</p>

<p>ROBERT GREENE</p>

<p>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</p>

<p>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</p>

<p>Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?</p>

<p>Then, Soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,</p>

<p>And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</p>

<p>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</p>

<p>Within be fed, without be rich no more:</p>

<p>So shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men, And, death once dead, there's no more dying then.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Forty-eighth Sonnet</p>

<p>O me! what eyes hath love put in my head, Which have no correspondence with true sight: Or if they have, where is my judgment fled That censures falsely what they see aright? If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, What means the world to say it is not so? If it be not, then love doth well denote Love's eye is not so true as all men's: No, How can it? O how can love's eye be true, That is so vex'd with watching and with tears? No marvel then though I mistake my view: The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.</p>

<p>O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind, Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find!</p>

<p>ROBERT GREENE [i56o(?)-i592]</p>

<p>Content</p>

<p>Sweet are the thoughts that savour of content, The quiet mind is richer than a crown,</p>

<p>Sweet are the nights in careless slumber spent, The poor estate scorns Fortune's angry frown:</p>

<p>Such sweet content, such minds, such sleep, such bliss,</p>

<p>Beggars enjoy, when princes oft do miss.</p>

<p>The homely house that harbours quiet rest,</p>

<p>The cottage that affords no pride nor care, The mean that 'grees with country music best,</p>

<p>RICHARD BARNFIELD</p>

<p>The sweet consort of mirth and modest fare, Obscured life sets down a type of bliss: A mind content both crown and kingdom is.</p>

<p>RICHARD BARNFIELD [1574-1627]</p>

<p>The Nightingale</p>

<p>As it fell upon a day</p>

<p>In the merry month of May,</p>

<p>Sitting in a pleasant shade</p>

<p>Which a grove of myrtles made,</p>

<p>Beasts did leap and birds did sing,</p>

<p>Trees did grow and plants did spring;</p>

<p>Every thing did banish moan</p>

<p>Save the Nightingale alone.</p>

<p>She, poor bird, as all forlorn,</p>

<p>Lean'd her breast up-till a thorn,</p>

<p>And there sung the dolefull'st ditty</p>

<p>That to hear it was great pity.</p>

<p>Fie, fie, fie, now would she cry;</p>

<p>Tereu, tereu, by and by:</p>

<p>That to hear her so complain</p>

<p>Scarce I could from tears refrain;</p>

<p>For her griefs so lively shown</p>

<p>Made me think upon mine own.</p>

<p>Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain,</p>

<p>None takes pity on thy pain:</p>

<p>Senseless trees, they cannot hear thee,</p>

<p>Ruthless beasts, they will not cheer thee;</p>

<p>King Pandion, he is dead,</p>

<p>All thy friends are lapp'd in lead:</p>

<p>All thy fellow birds do sing</p>

<p>Careless of thy sorrowing:</p>

<p>Even so, poor bird, like thee</p>

<p>None alive will pity me.</p>

<p>Cherry-Ripe</p>

<p>There is a garden in her face</p>

<p>Where roses and white lilies blow; A heavenly paradise is that place, Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow:</p>

<p>There cherries grow which none may buy Till 'Cherry-ripe' themselves do cry.</p>

<p>Those cherries fairly do enclose Of orient pearl a double row, Which when her lovely laughter shows, They look like rose-buds fill'd with snow; Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy Till 'Cherry-ripe' themselves do cry.</p>

<p>Her eyes like angels watch them still;</p>

<p>Her brows like bended bows do stand, Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill All that attempt with eye or hand Those sacred cherries to come nigh, Till 'Cherry-ripe' themselves do cry.</p>

<p>Follow.your Saint</p>

<p>Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet!</p>

<p>Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet!</p>

<p>There, wrapt in cloud of sorrow, pity move,</p>

<p>And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:</p>

<p>But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,</p>

<p>Then burst with sighing in her sight, and ne'er return againl</p>

<p>All that I sung still to her praise did tend; Still she was first, still she my songs did end; Yet she my love and music both doth fly, The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy: Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight! It shall suffice that they were breathed and died for her delight.</p>

<p>THOMAS CAMPION</p>

<p>When to Her Lute Corinna Sings</p>

<p>When to her lute Corinna sings,</p>

<p>Her voice revives the leaden strings,</p>

<p>And doth in highest notes appear,</p>

<p>As any challenged echo clear;</p>

<p>But when she doth of mourning speak,</p>

<p>E'en with her sighs, the strings do break,</p>

<p>And as her lute doth live or die,</p>

<p>Led by her passion, so must I:</p>

<p>For when of pleasure she doth sing,</p>

<p>My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,</p>

<p>But if she doth of sorrow speak,</p>

<p>E'en from my heart the strings do break.</p>

<p>Follow thy Fair Sun</p>

<p>Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow,</p>

<p>Though thou be black as night,</p>

<p>And she made all of light; Yet follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow!</p>

<p>Follow her, whose light thy light depriveth!</p>

<p>Though here thou livest disgraced,</p>

<p>And she in heaven is placed; Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth!</p>

<p>Follow those pure beams, whose beauty burneth!</p>

<p>That so have scorched thee;</p>

<p>As thou still black must be, Till her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth!</p>

<p>Follow her, while yet her glory shineth!</p>

<p>There comes a luckless night</p>

<p>That will dim all her light; And this the black unhappy shade divineth.</p>

<p>Follow still, since so thy Fates ordained!</p>

<p>The sun must have his shade,</p>

<p>Till both at once do fade; The sun still proved, the shadow still disdained!</p>

<p>Turn All thy Thoughts to Eyes</p>

<p>Turn all thy thoughts to eyes, Turn all thy hairs to ears, Change all thy friends to spies And all thy joys to fears:</p>

<p>True love will yet be free</p>

<p>In spite of jealousy.</p>

<p>Turn darkness into day, Conjectures into truth, Believe what th' envious say, Let age interpret youth:</p>

<p>True love will yet be free</p>

<p>In spite of jealousy.</p>

<p>Wrest every word and look, Rack every hidden thought, Or fish with golden hook; True love cannot be caught: For that will still be free In spite of jealousy.</p>

<p>Integer Vitae</p>

<p>The man of life upright,</p>

<p>Whose guiltless heart is free</p>

<p>From all dishonest deeds, Or thought of vanity;</p>

<p>The man whose silent days In harmless joys are spent,</p>

<p>Whom hopes cannot delude, Nor sorrow discontent;</p>

<p>That man needs neither towers Nor armour for defence,</p>

<p>Nor secret vaults to fly From thunder's violence:</p>

<p>He only can behold With unaffrighted eyes</p>

<p>EARL OF ESSEX</p>

<p>The horrors of the deep And terrors of the skies.</p>

<p>Thus, scorning all the cares That fate or fortune brings,</p>

<p>He makes the heaven his book, His wisdom heavenly things;</p>

<p>Good thoughts his only friends, His wealth a well-spent age,</p>

<p>The earth his sober inn And quiet pilgrimage.</p>

<p>ROBERT DEVEREUX, EARL OF ESSEX [1566-1601]</p>

<p>A Passion of my Lord of Essex</p>

<p>Happy were he could finish forth his fate</p>

<p>In some unhaunted desert, where, obscure From all society, from love and hate</p>

<p>Of worldly folk; then might he sleep secure; Then wake again, and ever give God praise,</p>

<p>Content with hip, with haws, and bramble-berry; In contemplation passing all his days,</p>

<p>And change of holy thoughts to make him merry; Who, when he dies, his tomb might be a bush, Where harmless Robin dwells with gende thrush. Happy were he!</p>

<p>SIR HENRY WOTTON [1568-1639]</p>

<p>Elizabeth of Bohemia</p>

<p>You meaner beauties of the night,</p>

<p>That poorly satisfy our eyes More by your number than your light,</p>

<p>You common people of the skies, What are you, when the Moon shall rise?</p>

<p>SIR HENRY WOTTON</p>

<p>Ye violets that first appear,</p>

<p>By your pure purple mantles known Like the proud virgins of the year,</p>

<p>As if the spring were all your own, What are you, when the Rose is blown?</p>

<p>Ye curious chanters of the wood</p>

<p>That warble forth dame Nature's lays,</p>

<p>Thinking your passions understood</p>

<p>By your weak accents; what's your praise</p>

<p>When Philomel her voice doth raise?</p>

<p>So when my Mistress shall be seen In sweetness of her looks and mind,</p>

<p>By virtue first, then choice, a Queen, Tell me, if she were not design'd</p>

<p>Th' eclipse and glory of her kind?</p>

<p>Character of a Happy Life</p>

<p>How happy is he born and taught That serveth not another's will; Whose armour is his honest thought And simple truth his utmost skill!</p>

<p>Whose passions not his masters are, Whose soul is still prepared for death, Not tied unto the world with care Of public fame, or private breath;</p>

<p>Who envies none that chance doth raise Or vice; Who never understood How deepest wounds are given by praise; Nor rules of state, but rules of good:</p>

<p>Who hath his life from rumours freed, Whose conscience is his strong retreat; Whose state can neither flatterers feed Nor ruin make oppressors great;</p>

<p>EARL OF OXFORD</p>

<p>Who God doth late and early pray More of his grace than gifts to lend; And entertains the harmless day With a well-chosen book or friend:</p>

<p>This man is freed from servile bands Of hope to rise, or fear to fall; Lord of himself, though not of lands; And having nothing, yet hath all.</p>

<p>EDWARD DE VERE, EARL OF OXFORD [1550-1604]</p>

<p>A Renunciation</p>

<p>If women could be fair, and yet not fond, Or that their love were firm, not fickle still, I would not marvel that they make men bond By service long to purchase their good will; But when I see how frail those creatures are, I muse that men forget themselves so far.</p>

<p>To mark the choice they make, and how they change, How oft from Phoebus they do flee to Pan; Unsettled still, like haggards wild they range, These gentle birds that fly from man to man; Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist, And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list?</p>

<p>Yet for disport we fawn and flatter both, To pass the time when nothing else can please, And train them to our lure with subtle oath, Till, weary of their wiles, ourselves we ease; And then we say when we their fancy try, To play with fools, O what a fool was I!</p>

<p>290</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>[i573-l637] 150 Simplex Munditiis</p>

<p>Still to be neat, still to be drest, As you were going to a feast; Still to be powdr'd, still perfumed: Lady, it is to be presumed, Though art's hid causes are not found, All is not sweet, all is not sound.</p>

<p>Give me a look, give me a face That makes simplicity a grace; Robes loosely flowing, hair as free: Such sweet neglect more taketh me Than all th' adulteries of art; They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.</p>

<p>757 The Triumph</p>

<p>See the Chariot at hand here of Love,</p>

<p>Wherein my Lady rideth! Each that draws is a swan or a dove,</p>

<p>And well the car Love guideth. As she goes, all hearts do duty</p>

<p>Unto her beauty; And enamour'd do wish, so they might</p>

<p>But enjoy such a sight, That they still were to run by her side, Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.</p>

<p>Do but look on her eyes, they do light</p>

<p>All that Love's world compriseth! Do but look on her hair, it is bright</p>

<p>As Love's star when it riseth! Do but mark, her forehead's smoother</p>

<p>Than words that soothe her; And from her arch'd brows such a grace</p>

<p>Sheds itself through the face, As alone there triumphs to the life All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.</p>

<p>BEN JONSON 29I</p>

<p>Have you seen but a bright lily grow</p>

<p>Before rude hands have touch'd it? Have you mark'd but the fall of the snow</p>

<p>Before the soil hath smutch'd it? Have you felt the wool of beaver,</p>

<p>Or swan's down ever? Or have smelt o' the bud o' the brier,</p>

<p>Or the nard in the fire? Or have tasted the bag of the bee? O so white, O so soft, O so sweet is she!</p>

<p>752 The Noble Nature</p>

<p>It is not growing like a tree</p>

<p>In bulk, doth make Man better be;</p>

<p>Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,</p>

<p>To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere: A lily of a day Is fairer far in May, Although it fall and die that night It was the plant and flower of Light</p>

<p>In small proportions we just beauties see;</p>

<p>And in short measures life may perfect be.</p>

<p>15$ To Celia</p>

<p>Drink to me only with thine eyes,</p>

<p>And I will pledge with mine; Or leave a kiss but in the cup</p>

<p>And I'll not look for wine. The thirst that from the soul doth rise</p>

<p>Doth ask a drink divine; But might I of Jove's nectar sup,</p>

<p>I would not change for thine.</p>

<p>I sent thee late a rosy wreath,</p>

<p>Not so much honouring thee As giving it a hope that there</p>

<p>It could not wither'd be; But thou thereon didst only breathe</p>

<p>And sent'st it back to me;</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>Since when it grows, and smells, I swear, Not of itself but thee!</p>

<p>A Farewell to the World</p>

<p>False world, good night! since thou hast brought</p>

<p>That hour upon my morn of age; Henceforth I quit thee from my thought,</p>

<p>My part is ended on thy stage.</p>

<p>Yes, threaten, do. Alas! I fear</p>

<p>As litde as I hope from thee: I know thou canst not show nor bear</p>

<p>More hatred than thou hast to me.</p>

<p>My tender, first, and simple years</p>

<p>Thou didst abuse and then betray; Since stir'd'st up jealousies and fears,</p>

<p>When all the causes were away.</p>

<p>Then in a soil hast planted me</p>

<p>Where breathe the basest of thy fools;</p>

<p>Where envious arts professed be, And pride and ignorance the schools;</p>

<p>Where nothing is examined, weigh'd,</p>

<p>But as 'tis rumour'd, so believed; Where every freedom is betray'd,</p>

<p>And every goodness tax'd or grieved.</p>

<p>But what we're born for, we must bear:</p>

<p>Our frail condition it is such That what to all may happen here,</p>

<p>If't chance to me, I must not grutch.</p>

<p>Else I my state should much mistake</p>

<p>To harbour a divided thought From all my kindthat, for my sake,</p>

<p>There should a miracle be wrought.</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>No, I do know that I was born To age, misfortune, sickness, grief:</p>

<p>But I will bear these with that scorn As shall not need thy false relief.</p>

<p>Nor for my peace will I go far, As wanderers do, that still do roam;</p>

<p>But make my strengths, such as they are, Here in my bosom, and at home.</p>

<p>A Nymph's Passion</p>

<p>I Love, and he loves me again,</p>

<p>Yet dare I not tell who; For if the nymphs should know my swain, I fear they'd love him too;</p>

<p>Yet if he be not known, The pleasure is as good as none, For that's a narrow joy is but our own.</p>

<p>I'll tell, that if they be not glad,</p>

<p>They may not envy me; But then if I grow jealous mad And of them pitied be,</p>

<p>It were a plague 'bove scorn; And yet it cannot be forborne Unless my heart would, as my thought, be torn.</p>

<p>He is, if they can find him, fair And fresh, and fragrant too, As summer's sky or purged air, And looks as lilies do</p>

<p>That are this morning blown: Yet, yet I doubt he is not known, And fear much more that more of him be shown.</p>

<p>But he hath eyes so round and bright,</p>

<p>As make away my doubt, Where Love may all his torches light, Though Hate had put them out;</p>

<p>But then t' increase my fears What nymph soe'er his voice but hears Will be my rival, though she have but ears.</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>I'll tell no more, and yet I love,</p>

<p>And he loves me; yet no One unbecoming thought doth move From either heart I know:</p>

<p>But so exempt from blame As it would be to each a fame, If love or fear would let me tell his name.</p>

<p>Epode</p>

<p>Not to know vice at all, and keep true state,</p>

<p>Is virtue, and not fate: Next to that virtue is to know vice well,</p>

<p>And her black spite expel, Which to effect (since no breast is so sure,</p>

<p>Or safe, but she'll procure Some way of entrance) we must plant a guard</p>

<p>Of thoughts to watch and ward At th' eye and ear, the ports unto the mind,</p>

<p>That no strange or unkind Object arrive there, but the heart, our spy,</p>

<p>Give knowledge instantly To wakeful reason, our affections' king:</p>

<p>Who, in th' examining, Will quickly taste the treason, and commit</p>

<p>Close, the close cause of it. 'Tis the securest policy we have,</p>

<p>To make our sense our slave. But this true course is not embraced by many:</p>

<p>By many? scarce by any. For either our affections do rebel,</p>

<p>Or else the sentinel, That should ring larum to the heart, doth sleep:</p>

<p>Or some great thought doth keep Back the intelligence, and falsely swears</p>

<p>They're base and idle fears Whereof the loyal conscience so complains.</p>

<p>Thus, by these subtle trains, Do several passions invade the mind,</p>

<p>And strike our reason blind:</p>

<p>BEN JONSON 295</p>

<p>Of which usurping rank, some have thought love.</p>

<p>The first, as prone to move Most frequent tumults, horrors, and unrests,</p>

<p>In our inflamed breasts: But this doth from the cloud of error grow,</p>

<p>Which thus we over-blow. The thing they here call Love is blind Desire,</p>

<p>Armed with bow, shafts, and fire; Inconstant, like the sea, of whence't is born,</p>

<p>Rough, swelling, like a storm; With whom who sails, rides on the surge of fear,</p>

<p>And boils as if he were In a continual tempest. Now, true Love</p>

<p>No such effects doth prove; That is an essence far more gende, fine,</p>

<p>Pure, perfect, nay, divine; It is a golden chain let down from heaven,</p>

<p>Whose links are bright and even, That falls like sleep on lovers, and combines</p>

<p>The soft and sweetest minds In equal knots: this bears no brands nor darts,</p>

<p>To murther different hearts, But in a calm and godlike unity</p>

<p>Preserves community. O, who is he that in this peace enjoys</p>

<p>Th' elixir of all joys? A form more fresh than are the Eden bowers,</p>

<p>And lasting as her flowers: Richer than Time, and as Time's virtue rare:</p>

<p>Sober, as saddest care; A fixed thought, an eye untaught to glance:</p>

<p>Who, blest with such high chance, Would, at suggestion of a steep desire,</p>

<p>Cast himself from the spire Of all his happiness? But, soft, I hear</p>

<p>Some vicious fool draw near, That cries we dream, and swears there's no such thing</p>

<p>As this chaste love we sing. Peace, Luxury, thou art like one of those</p>

<p>Who, being at sea, suppose,</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>Because they move, the continent doth so.</p>

<p>No, Vice, we let thee know, Though thy wild thoughts with sparrows' wings do fly,</p>

<p>Turtles can chastely die. And yet (in this t' express ourselves more clear)</p>

<p>We do not number here Such spirits as are only continent</p>

<p>Because lust's means are spent; Or those who doubt the common mouth of fame,</p>

<p>And for their place and name Cannot so safely sin. Their chastity</p>

<p>Is mere necessity. Nor mean we those whom vows and conscience</p>

<p>Have filled with abstinence: Though we acknowledge, who can so abstain</p>

<p>Makes a most blessed gain; He that for love of goodness hateth ill</p>

<p>Is more crown-worthy still Than he, which for sin's penalty forbears:</p>

<p>His heart sins, though he fears. But we propose a person like our Dove,</p>

<p>Grac'd with a Phcenix' love; A beauty of that clear and sparkling light,</p>

<p>Would make a day of night, And turn the blackest sorrows to bright joys:</p>

<p>Whose od'rous breath destroys All taste of bitterness, and makes the air</p>

<p>As sweet as she is fair. A body so harmoniously composed,</p>

<p>As if nature disclosed All her best symmetry in that one feature!</p>

<p>O, so divine a creature, Who could be false to? chiefly when he knows</p>

<p>How only she bestows The wealthy treasure of her love on him;</p>

<p>Making his fortunes swim In the full flood of her admired perfection?</p>

<p>What savage, brute affection Would not be fearful to offend a dame</p>

<p>Of this excelling frame?</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>Much more a noble and right generous mind</p>

<p>To virtuous moods inclined, That knows the weight of guilt: he will refrain</p>

<p>From thoughts of such a strain; And to his sense object this sentence ever, 'Man may securely sin, but safely never.'</p>

<p>Epitaph on Elizabeth L. H.</p>

<p>Woulds't thou hear what man can say</p>

<p>In a little? Reader, stay.</p>

<p>Underneath this stone doth lie</p>

<p>As much beauty as could die;</p>

<p>Which in life did harbour give</p>

<p>To more virtue than doth live.</p>

<p>If at all she had a fault</p>

<p>Leave it buried in this vault.</p>

<p>One name was Elizabeth,</p>

<p>The other, let it sleep with death,</p>

<p>Fitter, where it died, to tell,</p>

<p>Than that it lived at all. Farewell.</p>

<p>On Lucy, Countess of Bedford</p>

<p>This morning timely wrapt with holy fire,</p>

<p>I thought to form unto my zealous Muse,</p>

<p>What kind of creature I could most desire</p>

<p>To know, serve, and love, as Poets use.</p>

<p>I meant to make her fair, and free, and wise,</p>

<p>Of greatest blood, and yet more good than great;</p>

<p>I meant the day-star should not brighter rise,</p>

<p>Nor lend like influence from his lucent seat;</p>

<p>I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,</p>

<p>Hating that solemn vice of greatness, pride;</p>

<p>I meant each softest virtue there should meet,</p>

<p>Fit in that softer bosom to reside.</p>

<p>Only a learned, and a manly soul</p>

<p>I purposed her: that should with even powers,</p>

<p>The rock, the spindle, and the shears control</p>

<p>Of Destiny, and spin her own free hours.</p>

<p>Such when I meant to feign, and wished to see,</p>

<p>My Muse bade BEDFORD write, and that was she!</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>An Ode to Himself</p>

<p>Where dost thou careless lie</p>

<p>Buried in ease and sloth? Knowledge that sleeps, doth die And this security,</p>

<p>It is the common moth That eats on wits and arts, and that destroys them both.</p>

<p>Are all the Aonian springs</p>

<p>Dried up? lies Thespia waste? Doth Clarius' harp want strings, That not a nymph now sings;</p>

<p>Or droop they as disgraced, To see their seats and bowers by chattering pies defaced?</p>

<p>If hence thy silence be,</p>

<p>As 'tis too just a cause, Let this thought quicken thee: Minds that are great and free</p>

<p>Should not on fortune pause; 'Tis crown enough to virtue still, her own applause.</p>

<p>What though the greedy fry</p>

<p>Be taken with false baits Of worded balladry, And think it poesy?</p>

<p>They die with their conceits, And only piteous scorn upon their folly waits.</p>

<p>Then take in hand thy lyre;</p>

<p>Strike in thy proper strain; With Japhet's line aspire Sol's chariot, for new fire</p>

<p>To give the world again: Who aided him, will thee, the issue of Jove's brain.</p>

<p>And, since our dainty age Cannot endure reproof, Make not thyself a page</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>299</p>

<p>To that strumpet the stage;</p>

<p>But sing high and aloof, Safe from the wolf's black jaw, and the dull ass's hoof.</p>

<p>Queen and Huntress, chaste and fair, Now the sun is laid to sleep,</p>

<p>Seated in thy silver chair</p>

<p>State in wonted manner keep;</p>

<p>Earth, let not thy envious shade</p>

<p>Dare itself to interpose; Cynthia's shining orb was made</p>

<p>Heaven to clear when day did close: Bless us then with wished sight, Goddess excellently bright.</p>

<p>Lay thy bow of pearl apart</p>

<p>And thy crystal-shining quiver;</p>

<p>Give unto the flying hart</p>

<p>Space to breathe, how short soever:</p>

<p>Thou that mak'st a day of night, Goddess excellendy bright!</p>

<p>a child of queen elizabeth's chapel</p>

<p>Weep with me, all you that read</p>

<p>This little story; And know, for whom a tear you shed</p>

<p>Death's self is sorry. 'Twas a child that so did thrive</p>

<p>In grace and feature, As Heaven and Nature seem'd to strive</p>

<p>Which own'd the creature. Years he number'd scarce thirteen</p>

<p>When Fates turn'd cruel, Yet three fill'd zodiacs had he been</p>

<p>The stage's jewel;</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>And did act (what now we moan)</p>

<p>Old men so duly, As sooth the Parcae thought him one,</p>

<p>He play'd so truly. So, by error, to his fate</p>

<p>They all consented; But, viewing him since, alas, too late!</p>

<p>They have repented; And have sought, to give new birth,</p>

<p>In baths to steep him; But, being so much too good for earth,</p>

<p>Heaven vows to keep him.</p>

<p>His Supposed Mistress</p>

<p>If I freely can discover</p>

<p>What would please me in my lover,</p>

<p>I would have her fair and witty,</p>

<p>Savouring more of court than city;</p>

<p>A little proud, but full of pity;</p>

<p>Light and humourous in her toying;</p>

<p>Oft building hopes, and soon destroying;</p>

<p>Long, but sweet in the enjoying, Neither too easy, nor too hard: All extremes I would have barred.</p>

<p>She should be allowed her passions, So they were but used as fashions;</p>

<p>Sometimes froward, and then frowning, Sometimes sickish, and then swowning, Every fit with change still crowning. Purely jealous I would have her; Then only constant when I crave her, 'Tis a virtue should not save her. Thus, nor her delicates would cloy me, Neither her peevishness annoy me.</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>To the Memory of My Beloved The Author MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE and what he hath left us</p>

<p>[Prefixed to the First Folio Edition of Shakespeare's Plays.]</p>

<p>To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,</p>

<p>Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;</p>

<p>While I confess thy writings to be such</p>

<p>As neither man nor Muse can praise too much.</p>

<p>"Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways</p>

<p>Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;</p>

<p>For seeliest Ignorance on these may light,</p>

<p>Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;</p>

<p>Or blind Affection, which doth ne'er advance</p>

<p>The truth, but gropes and urgeth all by chance;</p>

<p>Or crafty Malice might pretend this praise,</p>

<p>And think to ruin where it seem'd to raise.</p>

<p>These are as some infamous bawd or whore</p>

<p>Should praise a matron. What could hurt her more?</p>

<p>But thou art proof against them, and, indeed,</p>

<p>Above the ill-fortune of them, or the need.</p>

<p>I, therefore, will begin. Soul of the age!</p>

<p>The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage,</p>

<p>My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by</p>

<p>Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie</p>

<p>A little further, to make thee a room:</p>

<p>Thou art a monument without a tomb,</p>

<p>And art alive still, while thy book doth live,</p>

<p>And we have wits to read, and praise to give.</p>

<p>That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses;</p>

<p>I mean, with great but disproportion'd Muses.</p>

<p>For, if I thought my judgment were of years,</p>

<p>I should commit thee, surely, with thy peers.</p>

<p>And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,</p>

<p>Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.</p>

<p>And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,</p>

<p>From thence, to honour thee, I would not seek</p>

<p>For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,</p>

<p>BEN JONSON</p>

<p>Euripides, and Sophocles to us,</p>

<p>Paccuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead</p>

<p>To life again, to hear thy buskin tread</p>

<p>And shake a stage; or when thy socks were on,</p>

<p>Leave thee alone, for the comparison</p>

<p>Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome</p>

<p>Sent forth; or since did from their ashes come.</p>

<p>Triumph, my Britain! Thou hast one to show</p>

<p>To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.</p>

<p>He was not of an age, but for all time!</p>

<p>And all the Muses still were in their prime,</p>

<p>When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm</p>

<p>Our ears, or, like a Mercury, to charm.</p>

<p>Nature herself was proud of his designs,</p>

<p>And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,</p>

<p>Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit</p>

<p>As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.</p>

<p>The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,</p>

<p>Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please;</p>

<p>But antiquated and deserted lie,</p>

<p>As they were not of Nature's family.</p>

<p>Yet must I not give Nature all! Thy art,</p>

<p>My gende Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.</p>

<p>For though the Poet's matter Nature be</p>

<p>His art doth give the fashion. And that he</p>

<p>Who casts to write a living line, must sweat</p>

<p>(Such as thine are), and strike the second heat</p>

<p>Upon the Muses' anvil, turn the same</p>

<p>(And himself with it), that he thinks to frame;</p>

<p>Or for the laurel he may gain a scorn!</p>

<p>For a good Poet's made as well as born;</p>

<p>And such wert thou! Look how the father's face</p>

<p>Lives in his issue; even so, the race</p>

<p>Of Shakespeare's mind and manners brightly shines</p>

<p>In his well-turned and true-filed lines;</p>

<p>In each of which he seems to shake a lance</p>

<p>As brandish'd at the eyes of Ignorance.</p>

<p>Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were</p>

<p>To see thee in our water yet appear,</p>

<p>And make those flights upon the banks of Thames</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE 3O3</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE [/57j-/6j/]</p>

<p>The Funeral</p>

<p>Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm</p>

<p>Nor question much That subde wreath of hair about mine arm; The mystery, the sign you must not touch,</p>

<p>For 'tis my outward soul, Viceroy to that which, unto heav'n being gone,</p>

<p>Will leave this to control And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.</p>

<p>For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall</p>

<p>Through every part Can tie those parts, and make me one of all; Those hairs, which upward grew, and strength and art</p>

<p>Have from a better brain, Can better do't: except she meant that I</p>

<p>By this should know my pain, As prisoners then are manacled, when they're condemn'd to die.</p>

<p>Whate'er she meant by't, bury it with me,</p>

<p>For since I am Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry If into other hands these reliques came.</p>

<p>As 'twas humility T' afford to it all that a soul can do,</p>

<p>So 'tis some bravery That, since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.</p>

<p>That so did take Eliza, and our James!</p>

<p>But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere</p>

<p>Advanc'd, and made a constellation there!</p>

<p>Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage</p>

<p>Or influence, chide, or cheer the drooping stage;</p>

<p>Which since thy flight from hence hath mourn'd like night,</p>

<p>And despairs day, but for thy volume's light.</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>A Hymn to God the Father</p>

<p>Wilt Thou forgive that sin where I begun, Which was my sin, though it were done before?</p>

<p>Wilt Thou forgive that sin through which I run, And do run still, though still I do deplore?</p>

<p>When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done; For I have more.</p>

<p>Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I have won Others to sin, and made my sins their door?</p>

<p>Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun A year or two, but wallow'd in a score?</p>

<p>When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done; For I have more.</p>

<p>I have a sin of fear, that when I've spun My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;</p>

<p>But swear by Thyself that at my death Thy Son Shall shine as He shines now and heretofore:</p>

<p>And having done that, Thou hast done; I fear no more.</p>

<p>Valediction, Forbidding Mourning</p>

<p>As virtuous men pass mildly away, And whisper to their souls to go;</p>

<p>While some of their sad friends do say, Now his breath goes, and some say, No;</p>

<p>So let us melt, and make no noise, No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;</p>

<p>'Twere profanation of our joys To tell the laity our love.</p>

<p>Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears Men reckon what it did and meant;</p>

<p>But trepidations of the spheres, Though greater far, are innocent.</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Dull sublunary lovers' love, Whose soul is sense, cannot admit</p>

<p>Absence; for that it doth remove Those things which elemented it.</p>

<p>But we, by a love so far refined, That ourselves know not what it is,</p>

<p>Inter-assured of the mind, Careless, eyes, lips and hands to miss,</p>

<p>Our two souls therefore, which are one, Though I must go, endure not yet</p>

<p>A breach, but an expansion, Like gold to airy thinness beat.</p>

<p>If they be two, they are two so</p>

<p>As stiff twin compasses are two; Thy soul, the fixt foot, makes no show</p>

<p>To move, but doth if th' other do.</p>

<p>And though it in the centre sit, Yet when the other far doth roam,</p>

<p>It leans and hearkens after it,</p>

<p>And grows erect as that comes home.</p>

<p>Such wilt thou be to me, who must, Like th' other foot, obliquely run;</p>

<p>Thy firmness makes my circles just, And makes me end where I begun.</p>

<p>Death</p>

<p>Death, be not proud, though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so: For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me. From Rest and Sleep, which but thy picture be, Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow; And soonest our best men with thee do go-Rest of their bones and souls' delivery!</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell; And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then? One short sleep past, we wake eternally, And Death shall be no more: Death, thou shalt die!</p>

<p>The Dream</p>

<p>Dear love, for nothing less than thee Would I have broke this happy dream;</p>

<p>It was a theme For reason, much too strong for fantasy. Therefore thou waked'st me wisely; yet My dream thou brak'st not, but continued'st it: Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice To make dreams truths and fables histories. Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.</p>

<p>As lightning, or a taper's light,</p>

<p>Thine eyes, and not thy noise, waked me;</p>

<p>Yet I thought thee For thou lov'st truthan angel at first sight; But when I saw thou saw'st my heart, And knew'st my thoughts beyond an angel's art, When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then, I must confess it could not choose but be Profane to think thee anything but thee.</p>

<p>Coming and staying show'd thee thee; But rising makes me doubt that now</p>

<p>Thou art not thou. That Love is weak where Fear's as strong as he; 'Tis not all spirit pure and brave, If mixture it of Fear, Shame, Honour have. Perchance, as torches, which must ready be, Men light and put out, so thou dealst with me. Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come: then I Will dream that hope again, but else would die.</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Song</p>

<p>Go and catch a falling star,</p>

<p>Get with child a mandrake root, Tell me where all past hours are,</p>

<p>Or who cleft the Devil's foot; Teach me to hear mermaids singing, Or to keep off envy's stinging, Or find What wind Serves to advance an honest mind.</p>

<p>If thou be'st born to strange sights,</p>

<p>Things invisible go see, Ride ten thousand days and nights, Till age snow white hairs on thee. Thou at thy return wilt tell me All strange wonders that befell thee, And swear, No where Lives a woman true and fair.</p>

<p>If thou find'st one, let me know, Such a pilgrimage were sweet; Yet do not, I would not go,</p>

<p>Though at next door we should meet. Though she were true when you met her, And last till you write your letter, Yet she Will be</p>

<p>False, ere I come, to two or three.</p>

<p>Sweetest Love, I Do Not Go Sweetest love, I do not go</p>

<p>For weariness of thee, Nor in hope the world can show A fitter love for me; But since that I Must die at last, 'tis best Thus to use myself in jest,</p>

<p>By feigned death to die.</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Yesternight the sun went hence,</p>

<p>And yet is here to-day; He hath no desire nor sense, Nor half so short a way. Then fear not me, But believe that I shall make Hastier journeys, since I take</p>

<p>More wings and spurs than he.</p>

<p>O how feeble is man's power,</p>

<p>That, if good fortune fall, Cannot add another hour, Nor a lost hour recall.</p>

<p>But come bad chance, And we join to it our strength, And we teach it art and length, Itself o'er us t' advance.</p>

<p>When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st no wind,</p>

<p>But sigh'st my soul away; When thou weep'st, unkindly kind, My life's blood doth decay. It cannot be That thou lov'st me as thou say'st, If in thine my life thou waste, That art the best of me.</p>

<p>Let not thy divining heart</p>

<p>Forethink me any ill. Destiny may take thy part And may thy fears fulfil; But think that we Are but turned aside to sleep: They who one another keep Alive, ne'er parted be.</p>

<p>Lover's Infiniteness</p>

<p>If yet I have not all thy love, Dear, I shall never have it all; I cannot breathe one other sigh to move,</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Nor can entreat one other tear to fall; And all my treasure, which should purchase thee, Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters, I have spent;</p>

<p>Yet no more can be due to me,</p>

<p>Than at the bargain made was meant: If, then, thy gift of love was partial, That some to me, some should to others fall,</p>

<p>Dear, I shall never have it all.</p>

<p>Or if then thou gavest me all, All was but all which thou hadst then; But if in thy heart since there be, or shall New love created be by other men, Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears, In sighs, in oaths, in letters outbid me, This new love may beget new fears; For this love was not vowed by thee, And yet it was, thy gift being general: The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall Grow there, dear, I should have it all.</p>

<p>Yet I would not have all yet; He that hath all can have no more; And since my love doth every day admit New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store. Thou canst not every day give me thy heart; If thou canst give it, then thou never gav'st it: Love's riddles are that, though thy heart depart, It stays at home, and thou with losing sav'st it, But we will love a way more liberal Than changing hearts,to join them; so we shall</p>

<p>Be one, an one another's All.</p>

<p>Love's Deity</p>

<p>I long to talk with some old lover's ghost, Who died before the god of love was born:</p>

<p>I cannot think that he, that then loved most, Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.</p>

<p>But since this god produced a destiny,</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be, I must love her that loves not me.</p>

<p>Sure they which made him god meant not so much, Nor he in his young godhead practised it;</p>

<p>But when an even flame two hearts did touch, His office was indulgently to fit</p>

<p>Actives to passives; correspondency</p>

<p>Only his subject was; it cannot be</p>

<p>Love, if I love who loves not me.</p>

<p>But every modern god will now extend</p>

<p>His vast prerogative as far as Jove; To rage, to lust, to write too, to commend;</p>

<p>All is the purlieu of the god of love.</p>

<p>0 were we wakened by his tyranny</p>

<p>To ungod this child again, it could not be</p>

<p>1 should love her that loves not me.</p>

<p>Rebel and atheist, too, why murmur I,</p>

<p>As though I felt the worst that love could do?</p>

<p>Love may make me leave loving, or might try A deeper plague, to make her love me too,</p>

<p>Which, since she loves before, I am loath to see,</p>

<p>Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,</p>

<p>If she whom I love should love me.</p>

<p>Stay, O Sweet</p>

<p>Stay, O sweet, and do not rise!</p>

<p>The light that shines comes from thine eyes; The day breaks not: it is my heart, Because that you and I must part. Stay! or else my joys will die, And perish in their infancy.</p>

<p>'Tis true, 'tis day: what though it be? O, wilt thou therefore rise from me?</p>

<p>Why should we rise because 'tis light? Did we lie down because 'twas night?</p>

<p>Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither,</p>

<p>Should in despite of light keep us together.</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Light hath no tongue, but is all eye. If it could speak as well as spy,</p>

<p>This were the worst that it could say: That, being well, I fain would stay,</p>

<p>And that I lov'd my heart and honour so,</p>

<p>That I would not from him, that had them, go.</p>

<p>Must business thee from hence remove? Oh, that's the worse disease of love!</p>

<p>The poor, the fool, the false, love can Admit, but not the busied man.</p>

<p>He, which hath business, and makes love, doth do</p>

<p>Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo.</p>

<p>The Blossom</p>

<p>Little think'st thou, poor flower,</p>

<p>Whom I have watched six or seven days,</p>

<p>And seen thy birth, and seen what every hour</p>

<p>Gave to thy growth, thee to this height to raise,</p>

<p>And now dost laugh and triumph on this bough,</p>

<p>Little think'st thou That it will freeze anon, and that I shall To-morrow find thee fall'n, or not at all.</p>

<p>Little think'st thou, poor heart,</p>

<p>That labourest yet to nestle thee,</p>

<p>And think'st by hovering here to get a part</p>

<p>In a forbidden or forbidding tree,</p>

<p>And hop'st her stiffness by long siege to bow,</p>

<p>Litde think'st thou That thou, to-morrow, ere the sun doth wake, Must with the sun and me a journey take.</p>

<p>But thou, which lov'st to be Subtle to plague thyself, wilt say "Alas! if you must go, what's that to me? Here lies my business, and here will I stay: You go to friends, whose love and means present Various content</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>To your eyes, ears, and taste, and every part: If then your body go, what need your heart?"</p>

<p>Well, then, stay here: but know</p>

<p>When thou hast said and done thy most,</p>

<p>A naked thinking heart, that makes no show,</p>

<p>Is to a woman but a kind of ghost;</p>

<p>How shall she know my heart? Or, having none,</p>

<p>Know thee for one? Practice may make her know some other part, But take my word, she doth not know a heart.</p>

<p>Meet me in London, then,</p>

<p>Twenty days hence, and thou shalt see</p>

<p>Me fresher and more fat, by being with men,</p>

<p>Than if I had stay'd still with her and thee.</p>

<p>For God's sake, if you can, be you so too:</p>

<p>I will give you There to another friend, whom you shall find As glad to have my body as my mind.</p>

<p>The Good Morrow</p>

<p>I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I</p>

<p>Did, till we loved? were we not weaned till then?</p>

<p>But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?</p>

<p>Or snored we in the Seven Sleepers' den?</p>

<p>'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be;</p>

<p>If ever any beauty I did see.</p>

<p>Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.</p>

<p>And now good-morrow to our waking souls,</p>

<p>Which watch not one another out of fear;</p>

<p>For love all love of other sights controls,</p>

<p>And makes one little room an everywhere.</p>

<p>Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone;</p>

<p>Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,</p>

<p>Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one.</p>

<p>My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;</p>

<p>JOHN DONNE</p>

<p>Where can we find two better hemispheres</p>

<p>Without sharp north, without declining west?</p>

<p>Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;</p>

<p>If our two loves be one, or thou and I</p>

<p>Love so alike that none can slacken, none can die.</p>

<p>Present in Absence</p>

<p>Absence, hear thou my protestation Against thy strength, Distance, and length; Do what thou canst for alteration: For hearts of truest mettle Absence doth join, and Time doth setde.</p>

<p>Who loves a mistress of such quality, His mind hath found Affection's ground Beyond time, place, and all mortality. To hearts that cannot vary Absence is present, Time doth tarry.</p>

<p>My senses want their outward motion Which now within Reason doth win, Redoubled by her secret notion: Like rich men that take pleasure In hiding more than handling treasure.</p>

<p>By absence this good means I gain, That I can catch her, Where none can watch her, In some close corner of my brain: There I embrace and kiss her; And so enjoy her and none miss her.</p>

<p>JOSHUA SYLVESTER</p>

<p>JOSHUA SYLVESTER [i563-1618]</p>

<p>Love's Omnipresence</p>

<p>Were I as base as is the lowly plain,</p>

<p>And you, my Love, as high as heaven above,</p>

<p>Yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain</p>

<p>Ascend to heaven, in honour of my Love.</p>

<p>Were I as high as heaven above the plain, And you, my Love, as humble and as low As are the deepest bottoms of the main, Whereso'er you were, with you my love should go.</p>

<p>Were you the earth, dear Love, and I the skies,</p>

<p>My love should shine on you like to the sun,</p>

<p>And look upon you with ten thousand eyes</p>

<p>Till heaven wax'd blind, and till the world were done.</p>

<p>Whereso'er I am, below, or else above you, Whereso'er you are, my heart shall truly love you.</p>

<p>WILLIAM ALEXANDER, EARL OF STIRLING [i567(?)-i64o]</p>

<p>To Aurora</p>

<p>O if thou knew'st how thou thyself dost harm, And dost prejudge thy bliss, and spoil my rest; Then thou would'st melt the ice out of thy breast And thy relenting heart would kindly warm.</p>

<p>O if thy pride did not our joys controul, What world of loving wonders should'st thou see! For if I saw thee once transform'd in me, Then in thy bosom I would pour my soul;</p>

<p>Then all my thoughts should in thy visage shine, And if that aught mischanced thou should'st not moan</p>

<p>RICHARD CORBET</p>

<p>Nor bear the burthen of thy griefs alone;</p>

<p>No, I would have my share in what were thine:</p>

<p>And whilst we thus should make our sorrows one, This happy harmony would make them none.</p>

<p>RICHARD CORBET [1582-1635]</p>

<p>Farewell, Rewards and Fairies</p>

<p>Farewell, rewards and fairies,</p>

<p>Good housewives now may say, For now foul sluts in dairies</p>

<p>Do fare as well as they. And though they sweep their hearths no less</p>

<p>Than maids were wont to do, Yet who of late for cleanness</p>

<p>Finds sixpence in her shoe?</p>

<p>Lament, lament, old Abbeys,</p>

<p>The Fairies' lost command! They did but change Priests' babies,</p>

<p>But some have changed your land. And all your children, sprung from thence,</p>

<p>Are now grown Puritans, Who live as Changelings ever since</p>

<p>For love of your demains.</p>

<p>At morning and at evening both</p>

<p>You merry were and glad, So little care of sleep or sloth</p>

<p>These pretty ladies had; When Tom came home from labour,</p>

<p>Or Cis to milking rose, Then merrily went their tabor,</p>

<p>And nimbly went their toes.</p>

<p>Witness those rings and roundelays</p>

<p>Of theirs, which yet remain, Were footed in Queen Mary's days</p>

<p>On many a grassy plain;</p>

<p>THOMAS HEYWOOD</p>

<p>But since of late, Elizabeth,</p>

<p>And later, James came in, They never danced on any heath</p>

<p>As when the time hath been.</p>

<p>By which we note the Fairies Were of the old Profession.</p>

<p>Their songs were 'Ave Mary's', Their dances were Procession.</p>

<p>But now, alas, they all are dead; Or gone beyond the seas;</p>

<p>Or farther for Religion fled;</p>

<p>Or else they take their ease.</p>

<p>A tell-tale in their company</p>

<p>They never could endure! And whoso kept not secredy</p>

<p>Their mirth, was punished, sure; It was a just and Christian deed</p>

<p>To pinch such black and blue. Oh how the commonwealth doth want</p>

<p>Such Justices as you!</p>

<p>THOMAS HEYWOOD [d. i65o(?)]</p>

<p>Pack, Clouds, Away</p>

<p>Pack, clouds, away, and welcome day,</p>

<p>With night we banish sorrow; Sweet air, blow soft, mount, larks, aloft</p>

<p>To give my Love good-morrow! Wings from the wind to please her mind,</p>

<p>Notes from the lark I'll borrow; Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale, sing,</p>

<p>To give my Love good-morrow; To give my Love good-morrow Notes from them both I'll borrow.</p>

<p>Wake from thy nest, Robin-red-breast, Sing, birds, in every furrow;</p>

<p>THOMAS DEKKER</p>

<p>And from each hill, let music shrill Give my fair Love good-morrow! Blackbird and thrush in every bush,</p>

<p>Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow! You pretty elves, amongst yourselves Sing my fair Love good-morrow; To give my Love good-morrow Sing, birds, in every furrow!</p>

<p>THOMAS DEKKER [/57o(?)-/6/4]</p>

<p>Country Glee</p>

<p>Haymakers, rakers, reapers, and mowers,</p>

<p>Wait on your Summer-Queen; Dress up with musk-rose her eglantine bowers, Daffodils strew the green; Sing, dance, and play, 'Tis holiday; The sun does bravely shine On our ears of corn. Rich as a pearl Comes every girl, This is mine, this is mine, this is mine; Let us die, ere away they be borne.</p>

<p>Bow to the Sun, to our Queen, and that fair one</p>

<p>Come to behold our sports; Each bonny lass here is counted a rare one As those in princes' courts. These and we With country glee, Will teach the woods to resound, And the hills with echoes hollow: Skipping lambs Their bleating dams, 'Mongst kids shall trip it round; For joy thus our wenches we follow.</p>

<p>Wind, jolly huntsmen, your neat bugles shrilly,</p>

<p>Hounds make a lusty cry; Spring up, you falconers, partridges freely, Then let your brave hawks fly. Horses amain, Over ridge, over plain, The dogs have the stag in chase: 'Tis a sport to content a king. So ho, ho! through the skies How the proud bird flies, And sousing, kills with a grace! Now the deer falls; hark! how they ring.</p>

<p>Cold's the Wind</p>

<p>Cold's the wind, and wet's the rain, Saint Hugh be our good speed! Ill is the weather that bringeth no gain, Nor helps good hearts in need.</p>

<p>Troll the bowl, the jolly nut-brown bowl, And here's, kind mate, to thee! Let's sing a dirge for Saint Hugh's soul, And down it merrily.</p>

<p>O Sweet Content</p>

<p>Art thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers?</p>

<p>O sweet content! Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplex'd ?</p>

<p>O punishment! Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vex'd To add to golden numbers, golden numbers?</p>

<p>O sweet content! O sweet, O Sweet content! Work apace, apace, apace, apace; Honest labour bears a lovely face; Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!</p>

<p>Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring?</p>

<p>O sweet content! Swimm'st thou in wealth, yet sink'st in thine own tears?</p>

<p>O punishment!</p>

<p>FRANCIS BEAUMONT</p>

<p>Then he that patiently want's burden bears No burden bears, but in a king, a king!</p>

<p>O sweet content! O sweet, O sweet content! Work apace, apace, apace, apace; Honest labour bears a lovely face; Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!</p>

<p>FRANCIS BEAUMONT [1584-1616]</p>

<p>On the Tombs in Westminster Abbey</p>

<p>Mortality, behold and fear What a change of flesh is here! Think how many royal bones Sleep within these heaps of stones; Here they lie, had realms and lands, Who now want strength to stir their hands, Where from their pulpits seal'd with dust They preach, 'In greatness is no trust.' Here's an acre sown indeed With the richest royallest seed That the earth did e'er suck in Since the first man died for sin: Here the bones of birth have cried 'Though gods they were, as men they died!' Here are sands, ignoble things, Dropt from the ruin'd sides of kings: Here's a world of pomp and state Buried in dust, once dead by fate.</p>

<p>Master Francis Beaumont's Letter to Ben Jonson</p>

<p>Written before he and Master Fletcher came to London</p>

<p>The sun (which doth the greatest comfort bring To absent friends, because the self-same thing They know they see, however absent) is Here our best haymaker (forgive me this; It is our country's style): in this warm shine I lie, and dream of your full Mermaid Wine.</p>

<p>FRANCIS BEAUMONT</p>

<p>O, we have Winter mixed with claret lees, Drink apt to bring in drier heresies Than beer, good only for the sonnet's strain, With fustian metaphors to stuff the brain; So mixed, that, given to the thirstiest one, 'Twill not prove alms, unless he have the stone: I think with one draught man's invention fades, Two cups had quite spoiled Homer's Iliads! 'Tis liquor that will find out Sutcliff's wit, Lie where he will, and make him write worse yet. Filled with such moisture, in most grievous qualms, Did Robert Wisdom write his singing Psalms; And so must I do this: and yet I think It is our potion sent us down to drink, By special Providence, keeps us from fights, Makes us not laugh, when we make legs to Knights: 'Tis this that keeps our minds fit for our states; A medicine to obey our Magistrates; For we do live more free than you; no hate, No envy at one another's happy state, Moves us; we are equal every whit; Of land that God gives men, here is their wit, If we consider fully; for our best And gravest man will with his main-house-jest Scarce please you: we want subtlety to do The city-tricks; lie, Hate, and flatter too: Here are none that can bear a painted show, Strike, when you wince, and then lament the blow; Who (like mills set the right way for to grind) Can make their gains alike with every wind: Only some fellows with the subdest pate Amongst us, may perchance equivocate At selling of a horse; and that's the most Methinks the little wit I had is lost Since I saw you; for wit is like a rest Held up at tennis, which men do the best With the best gamesters. What things have we seen Done at the Mermaid! heard words that have been So nimble, and so full of subtle flame, As if that every one (from whence they came) Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,</p>

<p>JOHN FLETCHER</p>

<p>And had resolved to live a fool the rest</p>

<p>Of his dull life;then when there hath been thrown</p>

<p>Wit able enough to justify the town</p>

<p>For three days past; wit that might warrant be</p>

<p>For the whole city to talk foolishly</p>

<p>Till that were cancelled; and, when we were gone,</p>

<p>We left an air behind us; which alone</p>

<p>Was able to make the two next companies</p>

<p>(Right witty; though but downright fools) more wise!</p>

<p>When I remember this, and see that now The country gentlemen begin to allow My wit for dry bobs, then I needs must cry, 'I see my days of ballating grow nigh!' I can already riddle, and can sing Catches, sell bargains: and I fear shall bring Myself to speak the hardest words I find Over as oft as any, with one wind, That takes no medicines. But one thought of thee Makes me remember all these things to be The wit of our young men, fellows that show No part of good, yet utter all they know; Who, like trees of the guard, have growing souls, Only strong Destiny, which all controls, I hope hath left a better fate in store For me, thy friend, than to live ever poor, Banished unto this home. Fate once again, Brings me to thee, who canst make smooth and plain The way of knowledge for me, and then I (Who have no good, but in thy company,) Protest it will my greatest comfort be, To acknowledge all I have, to flow from thee! Ben, when these Scenes are perfect, we'll taste wine! I'll drink thy Muse's health! thou shalt quaff mine!</p>

<p>My Love in Her Attire</p>

<p>My Love in her attire doth shew her wit,</p>

<p>It doth so well become her: For every season she hath dressings fit,</p>

<p>For Winter, Spring, and Summer. No beauty she doth miss When all her robes are on: But Beauty's self she is When all her robes are gone.</p>

<p>Love Not Me</p>

<p>Love not me for comely grace, For my pleasing eye or face, Nor for any outward part,</p>

<p>Saint John Baptist</p>

<p>The last and greatest Herald of Heaven's King Girt with rough skins, hies to the deserts wild, Among that savage brood the woods forth bring, Which he more harmless found than man, and mild. His food was locusts, and what there doth spring, With honey that from virgin hives distill'd; Parch'd body, hollow eyes, some uncouth thing Made him appear, long since from earth exiled. There burst he forth: All ye whose hopes rely On God, with me amidst these deserts mourn, Repent, repent, and from old errors turn! Who listen'd to his voice, obey'd his cry? Only the echoes, which he made relent, Rung from their flinty caves, Repent! Repent!</p>

<p>Madrigal</p>

<p>My thoughts hold mortal strife; I do detest my life, And with lamenting cries Peace to my soul to bring</p>

<p>Oft call that prince which here doth monarchize: But he, grim grinning King, Who caitiffs scorns, and doth the blest surprize, Late having deck'd with beauty's rose his tomb, Disdains to crop a weed, and will not come.</p>

<p>795 Life</p>

<p>This Life, which seems so fair,</p>

<p>Is like a bubble blown up in the air</p>

<p>By sporting children's breath,</p>

<p>Who chase it everywhere</p>

<p>And strive who can most motion it bequeath.</p>

<p>And though it sometimes seem of its own might</p>

<p>Like to an eye of gold to be fix'd there,</p>

<p>And firm to hover in that empty height,</p>

<p>That only is because it is so light.</p>

<p>But in that pomp it doth not long appear;</p>

<p>For when 'tis most admired, in a thought,</p>

<p>Because it erst was nought, it turns to nought.</p>

<p>796 Human Folly</p>

<p>Of this fair volume which we World do name If we the sheets and leaves could turn with care, Of him who it corrects, and did it frame, We clear might read the art and wisdom rare: Find out his power which wildest powers doth tame, His providence extending everywhere, His justice which proud rebels doth not spare, In every page, no period of the same. But silly we, like foolish children, rest Well pleased with colour'd vellum, leaves of gold. Fair dangling ribbands, leaving what is best, On the great writer's sense ne'er taking hold; Or if by chance we stay our minds on aught, It is some picture on the margin wrought.</p>

<p>797 The Problem</p>

<p>Doth then the world go thus, doth all thus move ?</p>

<p>Is this the justice which on Earth we find?</p>

<p>Is this that firm decree which all doth bind?</p>

<p>Are these your influences, Powers above?</p>

<p>Those souls which vice's moody mists most blind,</p>

<p>Blind Fortune, blindly, most their friend doth prove;</p>

<p>And they who thee, poor idol Virtue! love,</p>

<p>WILLIAM DRUMMOND</p>

<p>Ply like a feather toss'd by storm and wind.</p>

<p>Ah! if a Providence doth sway this all</p>

<p>Why should best minds groan under most distress?</p>

<p>Or why should pride humility make thrall,</p>

<p>And injuries the innocent oppress?</p>

<p>Heavens! hinder, stop this fate; or grant a time When good may have, as well as bad, their prime!</p>

<p>To His Lute</p>

<p>My lute, be as thou wert when thou didst grow With thy green mother in some shady grove, When immelodious winds but made thee move, And birds their ramage did on thee bestow. Since that dear Voice which did thy sounds approve, Which wont in such harmonious strains to flow, Is reft from Earth to tune those spheres above, What art thou but a harbinger of woe ? Thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more, But orphans' wailings to the fainting ear; Each stroke a sigh, each sound draws forth a tear; For which be silent as in woods before: Or if that any hand to touch thee deign, Like widow'd turtle still her loss complain.</p>

<p>For the Magdalene</p>

<p>'These eyes, dear Lord, once brandons of desire, Frail scouts betraying what they had to keep, Which their own heart, then others set on fire, Their trait'rous black before thee here out-weep; These locks, of blushing deeds the gilt attire, Waves curling, wrackful shelves to shadow deep, Rings wedding souls to sin's lethargic sleep, To touch thy sacred feet do now aspire. In seas of care behold a sinking bark, By winds of sharp remorse unto thee driven, O let me not be Ruin's aim'd-at-mark! My faults confessed, Lord, say they are forgiven.' Thus sighed to Jesus the Bethanian fair, His tear-wet feet still drying with her hair.</p>

<p>WILLIAM DRUMMOND</p>

<p>329</p>

<p>200 Content and Resolute</p>

<p>As when it happeneth that some lovely town Unto a barbarous besieger falls, Who there by sword and flame himself installs, And, cruel, it in tears and blood doth drown; Her beauty spoiled, her citizens made thralls, His spite yet so can not her all throw down But that some statue, arch, fane of renown Yet lurks unmaimed within her weeping walls: So, after all the spoil, disgrace, and wrack, That time, the world, and death, could bring combined, Amidst that mass of ruins they did make, Safe and all scarless yet remains my mind. From this so high transcending rapture springs, That I, all else defaced, not envy kings.</p>

<p>201 Alexis, Here She Stayed; Among These Pines</p>

<p>Alexis, here she stayed; among these pines, Sweet hermitress, she did alone repair; Here did she spread the treasure of her hair, More rich than that brought from the Colchian mines; She set her by these musked eglantines. The happy place the print seems yet to bear; Her voice did sweeten here thy sugared lines, To which winds, trees, beasts, birds, did lend their ear: Me here she first perceived, and here a morn Of bright carnations did o'erspread her face; Here did she sigh, here first my hopes were born, And I first got a pledge of promised grace; But ah! what served it to be happy so, Sith passed pleasures double but new woe?</p>

<p>202 Summons to Love</p>

<p>Phoebus, arise!</p>

<p>And paint the sable skies</p>

<p>With azure, white, and red:</p>

<p>Rouse Memnon's mother from her Tithon's bed</p>

<p>That she may thy career with roses spread:</p>

<p>WILLIAM DRUMMOND</p>

<p>The nightingales thy coming eachwhere sing:</p>

<p>Make an eternal Spring!</p>

<p>Give life to this dark world which lieth dead;</p>

<p>Spread forth thy golden hair</p>

<p>In larger locks than thou wast wont before,</p>

<p>And emperor-like decore</p>

<p>With diadem of pearl thy temples fair:</p>

<p>Chase hence the ugly night</p>

<p>Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light</p>

<p>This is that happy morn,</p>

<p>That day, long-wished day</p>

<p>Of all my life so dark,</p>

<p>(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn</p>

<p>And fates my hopes betray),</p>

<p>Which, purely white, deserves</p>

<p>An everlasting diamond should it mark.</p>

<p>This is the morn should bring unto this grove</p>

<p>My Love, to hear and recompense my love.</p>

<p>Fair King, who all preserves,</p>

<p>But show thy blushing beams,</p>

<p>And thou two sweeter eyes</p>

<p>Shalt see than those which by Peneus' streams</p>

<p>Did once thy heart surprize.</p>

<p>Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise:</p>

<p>If that ye winds would hear</p>

<p>A voice surpassing far Amphion's lyre,</p>

<p>Your furious chiding stay;</p>

<p>Let Zephyr only breathe,</p>

<p>And with her tresses play.</p>

<p>The winds all silent are,</p>

<p>And Phoebus in his chair</p>

<p>Ensaffroning sea and air</p>

<p>Makes vanish every star:</p>

<p>Night like a drunkard reels</p>

<p>Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels:</p>

<p>The fields with flowers are deck'd in every hue,</p>

<p>The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue;</p>

<p>Here is the pleasant place</p>

<p>And nothing wanting is, save She, alas!</p>

<p>Falero, lero, loo!</p>

<p>Her cheeks were like the cherry,</p>

<p>Her skin was white as snow; When she was blithe and merry</p>

<p>She angel-like did show; Her waist exceeding small,</p>

<p>The fives did fit her shoe: But now, alas! she's left me,</p>

<p>Falero, lero, loo!</p>

<p>No cares we ever knew: But now, alas! she's left me,</p>

<p>Valero, lero, loo!</p>

<p>To maidens' vows and swearing</p>

<p>Henceforth no credit give; You may give them the hearing,</p>

<p>Shall my foolish heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind; Or a well disposed nature Joined with a lovely feature? Be she meeker, kinder, than Turde-dove or pelican,</p>

<p>If she be not so to me</p>

<p>What care I how kind she be?</p>

<p>Shall a woman's virtues move Me to perish for her love? Or her merits' value known</p>

<p>WILLIAM BROWNE</p>

<p>Make me quite forget mine own? Be she with that goodness blest Which may gain her name of Best; If she seem not such to me, What care I how good she be?.</p>

<p>'Cause her fortune seems too high, Shall I play the fool and die? Those that bear a noble mind Where they want of riches find, Think what with them they would do Who without them dare to woo;</p>

<p>And unless that mind I see, What care I how great she be?</p>

<p>Great or good, or kind or fair, I will ne'er the more despair; If she love me, this believe, I will die ere she shall grieve; If she slight me when I woo, I can scorn and let her go;</p>

<p>For if she be not for me, What care I for whom she be?</p>

<p>To DlANEME</p>

<p>Sweet, be not proud of those two eyes Which starlike sparkle in their skies; Nor be you proud, that you can see All hearts your captives; yours yet free: Be you not proud of that rich hair Which wantons with the lovesick air; Whenas that ruby which you wear, Sunk from the tip of your soft ear, Will last to be a precious stone When all your world of beauty's gone.</p>

<p>A Sweet Disorder</p>

<p>A sweet disorder in the dress Kindles in clothes a wantonness: A lawn about the shoulders thrown Into a fine distraction, An erring lace, which here and there Enthrals the crimson stomacher, A cuff neglectful, and thereby Ribbands to flow confusedly, A winning wave, deserving note, In the tempestuous petticoat, A careless shoe-string, in whose tie I see a wild civility, Do more bewitch me, than when art Is too precise in every part.</p>

<p>Whenas in Silks</p>

<p>Whenas in silks my Julia goes</p>

<p>Then, then (methinks) how sweedy flows</p>

<p>That liquefaction of her clothes.</p>

<p>Next, when I cast mine eyes and see That brave vibration each way free; O how that glittering taketh me!</p>

<p>ROBERT HERRICK</p>

<p>337</p>

<p>2/j To Anthea who may Command Him</p>

<p>Any Thing</p>

<p>Bid me to live, and I will live</p>

<p>Thy Protestant to be: Or bid me love, and I will give</p>

<p>A loving heart to thee.</p>

<p>A heart as soft, a heart as kind, A heart as sound and free</p>

<p>As in the whole world thou canst find, That heart I'll give to thee.</p>

<p>Bid that heart stay, and it will stay,</p>

<p>To honour thy decree: Or bid it languish quite away,</p>

<p>And't shall do so for thee.</p>

<p>Bid me to weep, and I will weep While I have eyes to see:</p>

<p>And having none, yet I will keep A heart to weep for thee.</p>

<p>Bid me despair, and I'll despair, Under that cypress tree:</p>

<p>Or bid me die, and I will dare E'en Death, to die for thee.</p>

<p>Thou art my life, my love, my heart,</p>

<p>The very eyes of me, And hast command of every part,</p>

<p>To live and die for thee.</p>

<p>214 To Daffodils</p>

<p>Fair Daffodils, we weep to see You haste away so soon:</p>

<p>As yet the early-rising Sun Has not attain'd his noon. Stay, stay,</p>

<p>ROBERT HERRICK</p>

<p>Until the hasting day</p>

<p>Has run But to the even-song; And, having pray'd together, we Will go with you along.</p>

<p>We have short time to stay, as you,</p>

<p>We have as short a Spring! As quick a growth to meet decay As you, or any thing.</p>

<p>We die, As your hours do, and dry Away</p>

<p>Like to the Summer's rain; Or as the pearls of morning's dew Ne'er to be found again.</p>

<p>To Blossoms</p>

<p>Fair pledges of a fruitful tree,</p>

<p>Why do ye fall so fast?</p>

<p>Your date is not so past, But you may stay yet here awhile</p>

<p>To blush and gently smile, And go at last.</p>

<p>What, were ye born to be An hour or half's delight, And so to bid good-night?</p>

<p>'Twas pity Nature brought ye forth Merely to show your worth, And lose you quite.</p>

<p>But you are lovely leaves, where we May read how soon things have Their end, though ne'er so brave:</p>

<p>And after they have shown their pride Like you, awhile, they glide Into the grave.</p>

<p>ROBERT HERRICK</p>

<p>Corinna's Maying</p>

<p>Get up, get up for shame! The blooming morn</p>

<p>Upon her wings presents the god unshorn.</p>

<p>See how Aurora throws her fair</p>

<p>Fresh-quilted colours through the air:</p>

<p>Get up, sweet slug-a-bed, and see</p>

<p>The dew-bespangling herb and tree! Each flower has wept and bow'd toward the east, Above an hour since, yet you not drest;</p>

<p>Nay! not so much as out of bed?</p>

<p>When all the birds have matins said,</p>

<p>And sung their thankful hymns, 'tis sin,</p>

<p>Nay, profanation, to keep in, Whenas a thousand virgins on this day Spring, sooner than the lark, to fetch in May.</p>

<p>Rise, and put on your foliage, and be seen</p>

<p>To come forth, like the spring-time, fresh and green,</p>

<p>And sweet as Flora. Take no care</p>

<p>For jewels for your gown or hair:</p>

<p>Fear not; the leaves will strew</p>

<p>Gems in abundance upon you: Besides, the childhood of the day has kept, Against you come, some orient pearls unwept.</p>

<p>Come, and receive them while the light</p>

<p>Hangs on the dew-locks of the night,</p>

<p>And Titan on the eastern hill</p>

<p>Retires himself, or else stands still Till you come forth! Wash, dress, be brief in praying: Few beads are best when once we go a-Maying.</p>

<p>Come, my Corinna, come; and coming, mark How each field turns a street, each street a park,</p>

<p>Made green and trimm'd with trees! see how</p>

<p>Devotion gives each house a bough</p>

<p>Or branch! each porch, each door, ere this,</p>

<p>An ark, a tabernacle is, Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove, As if here were those cooler shades of love.</p>

<p>ROBERT HERRICK</p>

<p>Can such delights be in the street</p>

<p>And open fields, and we not see't?</p>

<p>Come, we'll abroad: and let's obey</p>

<p>The proclamation made for May, And sin no more, as we have done, by staying But, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying.</p>

<p>There's not a budding boy or girl this day But is got up and gone to bring in May.</p>

<p>A deal of youth, ere this, is come</p>

<p>Back, and with white-thorn laden home.</p>

<p>Some have dispatch'd their cakes and cream,</p>

<p>Before that we have left to dream: And some have wept and woo'd, and plighted troth, And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:</p>

<p>Many a green-gown has been given,</p>

<p>Many a kiss, both odd and even:</p>

<p>Many a glance, too, has been sent</p>

<p>From out the eye, love's firmament: Many a jest told of the keys betraying This night, and locks pick'd: yet we're not a-Maying.</p>

<p>Come, let us go, while we are in our prime, And take the harmless folly of the time!</p>

<p>We shall grow old apace, and die</p>

<p>Before we know our liberty.</p>

<p>Our life is short, and our days run</p>

<p>As fast away as does the sun. And, as a vapour or a drop of rain, Once lost, can ne'er be found again,</p>

<p>So when or you or I are made</p>

<p>A fable, song, or fleeting shade,</p>

<p>All love, all liking, all delight</p>

<p>Lies drowned with us in endless night. Then, while time serves, and we are but decaying, Come, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying.</p>

<p>FRANCIS QUARLES</p>

<p>FRANCIS QUARLES [7592-/644]</p>

<p>An Ecstasy</p>

<p>E'en like two little bank-dividing brooks,</p>

<p>That wash the pebbles with their wanton streams,</p>

<p>And having ranged and search'd a thousand nooks, Meet both at length in silver-breasted Thames, Where in a greater current they conjoin:</p>

<p>So I my Best-beloved's am; so He is mine.</p>

<p>E'en so we met; and after long pursuit, E'en so we joined; we both became entire;</p>

<p>No need for either to renew a suit, For I was flax, and He was flames of fire: Our firm-united souls did more than twine;</p>

<p>So I my Best-beloved's am; so He is mine.</p>

<p>If all those glittering Monarchs, that command The servile quarters of this earthly ball,</p>

<p>Should tender in exchange their shares of land, I would not change my fortunes for them all: Their wealth is but a counter to my coin:</p>

<p>The world's but theirs; but my Beloved's mine.</p>

<p>GEORGE HERBERT [1593-1633]</p>

<p>Love</p>

<p>Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back,</p>

<p>Guilty of dust and sin. But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack</p>

<p>From my first entrance in, Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning</p>

<p>If I lacked anything.</p>

<p>'A guest,' I answered, 'worthy to be here:' Love said, 'You shall be he.'</p>

<p>342 GEORGE HERBERT</p>

<p>'I, the unkind, ungrateful?   Ah, my dear,</p>

<p>I cannot look on Thee.' Love took my hand and smiling did reply,</p>

<p>'Who made the eyes but I?'</p>

<p>'Truth, Lord; but I have marred them: let my shame</p>

<p>Go where it doth deserve.' 'And know you not,' says Love, 'Who bore the blame?'</p>

<p>'My dear, then I will serve.' 'You must sit down,' says Love, 'and taste my meat.'</p>

<p>So I did sit and eat.</p>

<p>2/9 Virtue</p>

<p>Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright! The bridal of the earth and sky The dew shall weep thy fall to-night; For thou must die.</p>

<p>Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye, Thy root is ever in its grave, And thou must die.</p>

<p>Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses, A box where sweets compacted lie, My music shows ye have your closes, And all must die.</p>

<p>Only a sweet and virtuous soul, Like season'd timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal, Then chiefly lives.</p>

<p>220 The Elixir</p>

<p>Teach me, my God and King,</p>

<p>In all things Thee to see, And what I do in anything</p>

<p>To do it as for Thee.</p>

<p>GEORGE HERBERT 343</p>

<p>Not rudely, as a beast</p>

<p>To run into an action; But still to make Thee prepossest</p>

<p>And give it his perfection.</p>

<p>A man that looks on glass</p>

<p>On it may stay his eye, Or if he pleaseth, through it pass,</p>

<p>And then the heaven espy.</p>

<p>All may of Thee partake</p>

<p>Nothing can be so mean Which with his tincture, 'for Thy sake,'</p>

<p>Will not grow bright and clean.</p>

<p>A servant with this clause</p>

<p>Makes drudgery divine; Who sweeps a room, as for Thy laws,</p>

<p>Makes that and the action fine.</p>

<p>This is the famous stone</p>

<p>That turneth all to gold, For that which God doth touch and own</p>

<p>Cannot for less be told.</p>

<p>221 The Collar</p>

<p>I struck the board and cried, "No more;</p>

<p>I will abroad. What, shall I ever sigh and pine? My lines and life are free, free as the road, Loose as the wind, as large as store.</p>

<p>Shall I be still in suit? Have I no harvest but a thorn To let me blood, and not restore What I have lost with cordial fruit?</p>

<p>Sure there was wine Before my sighs did dry it; there was corn Before my tears did drown it. Is the year only lost to me? Have I no bays to crown it?</p>

<p>344 GEORGE HERBERT</p>

<p>No flowers, no garlands gay?   All blasted?</p>

<p>All wasted? Not so, my heart; but there is fruit,</p>

<p>And thou hast hands. Recover all thy sigh-blown age On double pleasure: leave thy cold dispute Of what is fit and not; forsake thy cage,</p>

<p>Thy rope of sands Which petty thoughts have made, and made to thee Good cable, to enforce and draw</p>

<p>And be thy law, While thou didst wink and wouldst not see.</p>

<p>Away: take heed,</p>

<p>I will abroad. Call in thy death's head there: tie up thy fears.</p>

<p>He that forbears</p>

<p>To suit and serve his need</p>

<p>Deserves his load." But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild</p>

<p>At every word, Methought I heard one calling 'Childl' And I replied, 'My Lord!'</p>

<p>222 The Flower</p>

<p>How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean Are thy returns! Ev'n as the flowers in Spring,</p>

<p>To which, besides their own demean, The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring; Grief melts away Like snow in May, As if there were no such cold thing.</p>

<p>Who would have thought my shrivell'd heart Could have recover'd greenness? It was gone</p>

<p>Quite under ground; as flowers depart To see their mother-root, when they have blown, Where they together All the hard weather, Dead to the world, keep house unknown.</p>

<p>GEORGE HERBERT</p>

<p>345</p>

<p>These are Thy wonders, Lord of power, Killing and quick'ning, bringing down to Hell</p>

<p>And up to Heaven in an hour; Making a chiming of a passing bell. We say amiss This or that is; Thy word is all, if we could spell.</p>

<p>O that I once past changing were, Fast in thy Paradise where no flower can wither!</p>

<p>Many a Spring I shoot up fair, Off'ring at Heaven, growing and groaning thither; Nor doth my flower Want a Spring shower, My sins and I joining together.</p>

<p>225 Easter Song</p>

<p>I got me flowers to strew Thy way, I got me boughs off many a tree;</p>

<p>But Thou wast up by break of day, And brought'st Thy sweets along with Thee.</p>

<p>The sun arising in the East,</p>

<p>Though he give light and th' East perfume, If they should offer to contest</p>

<p>With Thy arising, they presume.</p>

<p>Can there be any day but this, Though many suns to shine endeavour?</p>

<p>We count three hundred, but we miss: There is but one, and that one ever.</p>

<p>224 The Pulley</p>

<p>When God at first made Man, Having a glass of blessings standing by Let us (said He) pour on him all we can; Let the world's riches, which dispersed lie,</p>

<p>Contract into a span.</p>

<p>HENRY VAUGHAN</p>

<p>So strength first made a way, Then beauty flow'd, then wisdom, honour, pleasure; When almost all was out, God made a stay, Perceiving that, alone of all His treasure,</p>

<p>Rest in the bottom lay.</p>

<p>For if I should (said He) Bestow this jewel also on My creature, He would adore My gifts instead of Me, And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature:</p>

<p>So both should losers be.</p>

<p>Yet let him keep the rest, But keep them with repining restlessness; Let him be rich and weary, that at least, If goodness lead him not, yet weariness</p>

<p>May toss him to My breast.</p>

<p>HENRY VAUGHAN [7622-/695]</p>

<p>Beyond the Veil</p>

<p>They are all gone into the world of lightl</p>

<p>And I alone sit lingering here; Their very memory is fair and bright,</p>

<p>And my sad thoughts doth clear.</p>

<p>It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,</p>

<p>Like stars upon some gloomy grove, Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest, After the sun's remove.</p>

<p>I see them walking in an air of glory,</p>

<p>Whose light doth trample on my days; My days, which are at best but dull and hoary, Mere glimmerings and decays.</p>

<p>O holy Hope, and high Humility,</p>

<p>High as the heavens above! These are your walks, and you have showed them me To kindle my cold love.</p>

<p>HENRY VAUGHAN 347</p>

<p>Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the just,</p>

<p>Shining nowhere but in the dark, What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust,</p>

<p>Could Man outlook that mark!</p>

<p>He that hath found some fledged bird's nest, may know</p>

<p>At first sight, if the bird be flown; But what fair well or grove he sings in now, That is to him unknown.</p>

<p>And yet, as Angels in some brighter dreams</p>

<p>Call to the soul when man doth sleep, So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes, And into glory peep.</p>

<p>If a star were confined into a tomb,</p>

<p>Her captive flames must needs burn there; But when the hand that locked her up, gives room, She'll shine through all the sphere.</p>

<p>O Father of eternal life, and all</p>

<p>Created glories under Thee! Resume Thy spirit from this world of thrall Into true liberty.</p>

<p>Either disperse these mists, which blot and fill</p>

<p>My perspective still, as they pass; Or else remove me hence unto that hill Where I shall need no glass.</p>

<p>The Retreat</p>

<p>Happy those early days, when I Shined in my Angel-infancy! Before I understood this place Appointed for my second race, Or taught my soul to fancy aught But a white, celestial thought; When yet I had not walk'd above A mile or two from my first Love, And looking back, at that short space</p>

<p>FRANCIS BACON</p>

<p>Could see a glimpse of his bright face;</p>

<p>When on some gilded cloud or flower</p>

<p>My gazing soul would dwell an hour,</p>

<p>And in those weaker glories spy</p>

<p>Some shadows of eternity;</p>

<p>Before I taught my tongue to wound</p>

<p>My conscience with a sinful sound,</p>

<p>Or had the black art to dispense</p>

<p>A several sin to every sense,</p>

<p>But felt through all this fleshly dress</p>

<p>Bright shoots of everlastingness.</p>

<p>O how I long to travel back, And tread again that ancient track! That I might once more reach that plain Where first I left my glorious train; From whence th' enlighten'd spirit sees That shady City of Palm trees! But ah! my soul with too much stay Is drunk, and staggers in the way: Some men a forward motion love, But I by backward steps would move; And when this dust falls to the urn, In that state I came, return.</p>

<p>FRANCIS BACON, VISCOUNT ST. ALBAN [7567-/626]</p>

<p>Life</p>

<p>The world's a bubble and the life of Man</p>

<p>Less than a span; In his conception wretched, from the womb</p>

<p>So to the tomb; Curst from his cradle, and brought up to years</p>

<p>With cares and fears. Who then to frail mortality shall trust, But limns on water, or but writes in dust.</p>

<p>Yet whilst with sorrow here we live opprest, What life is best?</p>

<p>JAMES SHIRLEY</p>

<p>349</p>

<p>Courts are but only superficial schools</p>

<p>To dandle fools: The rural parts are turn'd into a den</p>

<p>Of savage men: And where's a city from foul vice so free, But may be termed the worst of all the three ?</p>

<p>Domestic cares afflict the husband's bed,</p>

<p>Or pains his head: Those that live single, take it for a curse</p>

<p>Or do things worse: Some would have children: those that have them moan</p>

<p>Or wish them gone: What is it, then, to have, or have no wife, But single thraldom or a double strife?</p>

<p>But our affections still at home to please</p>

<p>Is a disease: To cross the seas to any foreign soil,</p>

<p>Peril and toil: Wars with their noise affright us: when they cease,</p>

<p>We are worse in peace; What then remains, but that we still should cry For being born, or being born, to die?</p>

<p>JAMES SHIRLEY</p>

<p>[1506-1666]</p>

<p>The Glories of our Blood and State</p>

<p>The glories of our blood and state</p>

<p>Are shadows, not substantial things; There is no armour against fate;</p>

<p>Death lays his icy hand on kings: Sceptre and Crown Must tumble down, And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade.</p>

<p>JAMES SHIRLEY</p>

<p>Some men with swords may reap the field, And plant fresh laurels where they kill: But their strong nerves at last must yield; They tame but one another still: Early or late They stoop to fate, And must give up their murmuring breath When they, pale captives, creep to death.</p>

<p>The garlands wither on your brow;</p>

<p>Then boast no more your mighty deeds; Upon Death's purple altar now</p>

<p>See where the victor-victim bleeds: Your heads must come To the cold tomb; Only the actions of the just Smell sweet, and blossom in their dust.</p>

<p>The Last Conqueror</p>

<p>Victorious men of earth, no more Proclaim how wide your empires are;</p>

<p>Though you bind-in every shore And your triumphs reach as far</p>

<p>As night or day, Yet you, proud monarchs, must obey</p>

<p>And mingle with forgotten ashes, when</p>

<p>Death calls ye to the crowd of common men.</p>

<p>Devouring Famine, Plague, and War,</p>

<p>Each able to undo mankind, Death's servile emissaries are;</p>

<p>Nor to these alone confined. He hath at will</p>

<p>More quaint and subtle ways to kill; A smile or kiss, as he will use the art, Shall have the cunning skill to break a heart.</p>

<p>THOMAS CAREW</p>

<p>THOMAS CAREW [i595(?)-i639(?)}</p>

<p>The True Beauty</p>

<p>He that loves a rosy cheek</p>

<p>Or a coral lip admires, Or from star-like eyes doth seek</p>

<p>Fuel to maintain his fires; As old Time makes these decay, So his flames must waste away.</p>

<p>But a smooth and steadfast mind, Gentle thoughts, and calm desires,</p>

<p>Hearts with equal love combined, Kindle never-dying fires:</p>

<p>Where these are not, I despise</p>

<p>Lovely cheeks or lips or eyes.</p>

<p>Ask Me No More</p>

<p>Ask me no more where Jove bestows, When June is past, the fading rose; For in your beauty's orient deep These flowers, as in their causes, sleep.</p>

<p>Ask me no more whither do stray The golden atoms of the day; For in pure love did heaven prepare Those powders to enrich your hair.</p>

<p>Ask me no more whither doth haste The nightingale when May is past; For in your sweet dividing throat She winters and keeps warm her note.</p>

<p>Ask me no more where those stars 'light That downwards fall in dead of night; For in your eyes they sit, and there Fixed become as in their sphere.</p>

<p>THOMAS CAREW</p>

<p>Ask me no more if east or west The Phcenix builds her spicy nest; For unto you at last she flies, And in your fragrant bosom dies.</p>

<p>Know, Celia</p>

<p>Know, Celia, since thou art so proud, 'Twas I that gave thee thy renown;</p>

<p>Thou hadst in the forgotten crowd Of common beauties lived unknown,</p>

<p>Had not my verse extoll'd thy name,</p>

<p>And with it imp'd the wings of Fame.</p>

<p>That killing power is none of thine: I gave it to thy voice and eyes;</p>

<p>Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine; Thou art my star, shin'st in my skies;</p>

<p>Then dart not from thy borrowed sphere</p>

<p>Lightning on him that fixed thee there.</p>

<p>Tempt me with such affrights no more,</p>

<p>Lest what I made I uncreate; Let fools thy mystic forms adore,</p>

<p>I know thee in thy mortal state: Wise poets, that wrapt Truth in tales, Knew her themselves through all her veils.</p>

<p>Give Me More Love</p>

<p>Give me more love, or more disdain;</p>

<p>The torrid or the frozen zone Bring equal ease unto my pain;</p>

<p>The temperate affords me none: Either extreme, of love or hate, Is sweeter than a calm estate.</p>

<p>Give me a storm; if it be love Like Danae in that golden shower,</p>

<p>I'll swim in pleasure; if it prove Disdain, that torrent will devour</p>

<p>SIR JOHN SUCKLING</p>

<p>My vulture hopes; and he's possessed Of heaven, that's from hell released. Then crown my joys, or cure my pain; Give me more love, or more disdain.</p>

<p>SIR JOHN SUCKLING [1609-1642]</p>

<p>The Constant Lover</p>

<p>Out upon it, I have loved Three whole days together!</p>

<p>And am like to love three more, If it prove fair weather.</p>

<p>Time shall moult away his wings</p>

<p>Ere he shall discover In the whole wide world again Such a constant lover.</p>

<p>But the spite on't is, no praise</p>

<p>Is due at all to me: Love with me had made no stays,</p>

<p>Had it any been but she.</p>

<p>Had it any been but she,</p>

<p>And that very face, There had been at least ere this</p>

<p>A dozen dozen in her place.</p>

<p>Why so Pale and Wan</p>

<p>Why so pale and wan, fond lover?</p>

<p>Prythee, why so pale? Will, if looking well can't move her,</p>

<p>Looking ill prevail?</p>

<p>Prythee, why so pale?</p>

<p>Why so dull and mute, young sinner? Prythee, why so mute?</p>

<p>SIR WILLIAM D'AVENANT</p>

<p>Will, when speaking well can't win her, Saying nothing do't? Prythee, why so mute?</p>

<p>Quit, quit, for shame! this will not move,</p>

<p>This cannot take her; If of hetself she will not love,</p>

<p>Nothing can make her:</p>

<p>The devil take her!</p>

<p>SIR WILLIAM D'AVENANT</p>

<p>[1606-1668]</p>

<p>Dawn Song</p>

<p>The lark now leaves his wat'ry nest, And climbing shakes his dewy wings.</p>

<p>He takes this window for the East, And to implore your light he sings</p>

<p>Awake, awake! the morn will never rise</p>

<p>Till she can dress her beauty at your eyes.</p>

<p>The merchant bows unto the seaman's star,</p>

<p>The ploughman from the sun his season takes;</p>

<p>But still the lover wonders what they are Who look for day before his mistress wakes.</p>

<p>Awake, awake! break thro' your veils of lawn!</p>

<p>Then draw your curtains, and begin the dawn!</p>

<p>RICHARD LOVELACE [1618-1658]</p>

<p>To Lucasta, on Going to the Wars</p>

<p>Tell me not, Sweet, I am unkind</p>

<p>That from the nunnery Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,</p>

<p>To war and arms I fly.</p>

<p>RICHARD LOVELACE</p>

<p>True, a new mistress now I chase,</p>

<p>The first foe in the field; And with a stronger faith embrace</p>

<p>A sword, a horse, a shield.</p>

<p>Yet this inconstancy is such</p>

<p>As you too shall adore; I could not love thee, Dear, so much,</p>

<p>Loved I not Honour more.</p>

<p>To Althea from Prison</p>

<p>When Love with unconfined wings</p>

<p>Hovers within my gates, And my divine Althea brings</p>

<p>To whisper at the grates; When I lie tangled in her hair</p>

<p>And fetter'd to her eye, The birds that wanton in the air</p>

<p>Know no such liberty.</p>

<p>When flowing cups run swiftly round</p>

<p>With no allaying Thames, Our careless heads with roses crown'd,</p>

<p>Our hearts with loyal flames; When thirsty grief in wine we steep,</p>

<p>When healths and draughts go free Fishes that tipple in the deep</p>

<p>Know no such liberty.</p>

<p>When, linnet-like confined I</p>

<p>With shriller throat shall sing The sweetness, mercy, majesty</p>

<p>And glories of my King; When I shall voice aloud how good</p>

<p>He is, how great should be, Enlarged winds, that curl the flood,</p>

<p>Know no such liberty.</p>

<p>Stone walls do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage;</p>

<p>RICHARD LOVELACE</p>

<p>Minds innocent and quiet take</p>

<p>That for an hermitage; If I have freedom in my love</p>

<p>And in my soul am free, Angels alone, that soar above,</p>

<p>Enjoy such liberty.</p>

<p>To Lucasta, Going Beyond the Seas</p>

<p>If to be absent were to be Away from thee; Or that when I am gone You or I were alone; Then, my Lucasta, might I crave Pity from blustering wind, or swallowing wave.</p>

<p>But I'll not sigh one blast or gale To swell my sail, Or pay a tear to 'suage The foaming blue god's rage; For whether he will let me pass Or no, I'm still as happy as I was.</p>

<p>Though seas and land betwixt us both, Our faith and troth, Like separated souls, All time and space controls: Above the highest sphere we meet Unseen, unknown, and greet as Angels greet.</p>

<p>So then we do anticipate Our after-fate, And are alive i' the skies, If thus our lips and eyes Can speak like spirits unconfined In Heaven, their earthly bodies left behind.</p>

<p>EDMUND WALLER</p>

<p>[1606-1687]</p>

<p>On a Girdle</p>

<p>That which her slender waist confined Shall now my joyful temples bind; No monarch but would give his crown His arms might do what this has done.</p>

<p>It was my Heaven's extremest sphere, The pale which held that lovely deer: My joy, my grief, my hope, my love, Did all within this circle move.</p>

<p>A narrow compass! and yet there Dwelt all that's good, and all that's fair: Give me but what this ribband bound, Take all the rest the Sun goes round.</p>

<p>Go, Lovely Rose!</p>

<p>Go, lovely Rose! Tell her, that wastes her time and me,</p>

<p>That now she knows, When I resemble her to thee, How sweet and fair she seems to be.</p>

<p>Tell her that's young And shuns to have her graces spied,</p>

<p>That hadst thou sprung In deserts, where no men abide, Thou must have uncommended died.</p>

<p>Small is the worth Of beauty from the light retired:</p>

<p>Bid her come forth, Suffer herself to be desired, And not blush so to be admired.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT</p>

<p>Then die! that she The common fate of all things rare</p>

<p>May read in thee: How small a part of time they share They are so wondrous sweet and fair!</p>

<p>WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT [1611-1643]</p>

<p>On the Queen's Return from the Low Countries</p>

<p>Hallow the threshold, crown the posts anew!</p>

<p>The day shall have its due. Twist all our victories into one bright wreath,</p>

<p>On which let honour breathe: Then throw it round the temples of our Queen! 'Tis she that must preserve those glories green.</p>

<p>When greater tempests than on sea before</p>

<p>Received her on the shore; When she was shot at 'for the King's own good'</p>

<p>By legions hired to blood; How bravely did she do, how bravely bear! And show'd, though they durst rage, she durst not fear.</p>

<p>Courage was cast about her like a dress</p>

<p>Of solemn comeliness: A gather'd mind and an untroubled face</p>

<p>Did give her dangers grace: Thus, arm'd with innocence, secure they move Whose highest 'treason' is but highest love.</p>

<p>JAMES GRAHAM, MARQUIS OF MONTROSE [1612-1650]</p>

<p>My Dear and Only Love</p>

<p>My dear and only Love, I pray</p>

<p>That little world of thee Be govern'd by no other sway</p>

<p>Than purest monarchy;</p>

<p>RICHARD CRASHAW</p>

<p>For if confusion have a part (Which virtuous souls abhor),</p>

<p>And hold a synod in thine heart, I'll never love thee more.</p>

<p>Like Alexander I will reign,</p>

<p>And I will reign alone; My thoughts did evermore disdain</p>

<p>A rival on my throne. He either fears his fate too much,</p>

<p>Or his deserts are small, That dares not put it to the touch,</p>

<p>To gain or lose it all.</p>

<p>And in the empire of thine heart,</p>

<p>Where I should solely be, If others do pretend a part</p>

<p>Or dare to vie with me, Or if Committees thou erect,</p>

<p>And go on such a score, I'll laugh and sing at thy neglect,</p>

<p>And never love thee more.</p>

<p>But if thou wilt prove faithful then,</p>

<p>And constant of thy word, I'll make thee glorious by my pen</p>

<p>And famous by my sword; I'll serve thee in such noble ways</p>

<p>Was never heard before; I'll crown and deck thee all with bays,</p>

<p>And love thee more and more.</p>

<p>Wishes for the Supposed Mistress</p>

<p>Whoe'er she be,</p>

<p>That shall command my heart and me;</p>

<p>RICHARD CRASHAW</p>

<p>Where'er she lie,</p>

<p>Lock'd up from mortal eye</p>

<p>In shady leaves of destiny:</p>

<p>Till that ripe birth</p>

<p>Of studied Fate stand forth,</p>

<p>And teach her fair steps tread our earth;</p>

<p>Till that divine Idea take a shrine</p>

<p>Of crystal flesh, through which to shine:</p>

<p>Meet you her, my Wishes,</p>

<p>Bespeak her to my blisses,</p>

<p>And be ye call'd, my absent kisses.</p>

<p>I wish her Beauty</p>

<p>That owes not all its duty</p>

<p>To gaudy tire, or glist'ring shoe-tie:</p>

<p>Something more than Taffata or tissue can, Or rampant feather, or rich fan.</p>

<p>A Face that's best</p>

<p>By its own beauty drest,</p>

<p>And can alone commend the rest:</p>

<p>A Face made up</p>

<p>Out of no other shop</p>

<p>Than what Nature's white hand sets ope.</p>

<p>A Cheek, where youth And blood, with pen of truth, Write what the reader sweedy ru'th.</p>

<p>A Cheek, where grows More than a morning rose, Which to no box his being owes.</p>

<p>RICHARD CRASHAW</p>

<p>Lips, where all day</p>

<p>A lover's kiss may play,</p>

<p>Yet carry nothing thence away.</p>

<p>Looks, that oppress</p>

<p>Their richest tires, but dress</p>

<p>And clothe their simplest nakedness.</p>

<p>Eyes, that displace</p>

<p>The neighbor diamond, and outface</p>

<p>That sunshine by their own sweet grace.</p>

<p>Tresses, that wear Jewels but to declare</p>

<p>How much themselves more precious are:</p>

<p>Whose native ray</p>

<p>Can tame the wanton day</p>

<p>Of gems that in their bright shades play.</p>

<p>Each ruby there,</p>

<p>Or pearl that dare appear,</p>

<p>Be its own blush, be its own tear.</p>

<p>A well-tamed Heart,</p>

<p>For whose more noble smart</p>

<p>Love may be long choosing a dart.</p>

<p>Eyes, that bestow</p>

<p>Full quivers on love's bow,</p>

<p>Yet pay less arrows than they owe.</p>

<p>Smiles, that can warm</p>

<p>The blood, yet teach a charm,</p>

<p>That chastity shall take no harm.</p>

<p>Blushes, that bin</p>

<p>The burnish of no sin,</p>

<p>Nor flames of aught too hot within.</p>

<p>RICHARD CRASHAW</p>

<p>Joys, that confess</p>

<p>Virtue their mistress,</p>

<p>And have no other head to dress.</p>

<p>Fears, fond and slight</p>

<p>As the coy bride's, when night</p>

<p>First does the longing lover right.</p>

<p>Days, that need borrow</p>

<p>No part of their good morrow</p>

<p>From a fore-spent night of sorrow:</p>

<p>Days, that in spite</p>

<p>Of darkness, by the light</p>

<p>Of a clear mind are day all night.</p>

<p>Nights, sweet as they Made short by lovers' play, Yet long by th' absence of day.</p>

<p>Life, that dares send</p>

<p>A challenge to his end,</p>

<p>And when it comes, say, 'Welcome, friend.'</p>

<p>Sydneian Showers</p>

<p>Of sweet discourse, whose powers</p>

<p>Can crown old Winter's head with flowers.</p>

<p>Soft silken hours,</p>

<p>Open suns, shady bowers;</p>

<p>'Bove all, nothing within that lowers.</p>

<p>Whate'er delight</p>

<p>Can make Day's forehead bright</p>

<p>Or give down to the wings of night.</p>

<p>I wish her store</p>

<p>Of worth may leave her poor</p>

<p>Of wishes; and I wishno more.</p>

<p>RICHARD CRASHAW</p>

<p>Now, if Time knows</p>

<p>That Her, whose radiant brows</p>

<p>Weave them a garland of my vows;</p>

<p>Her, whose just bays</p>

<p>My future hopes can raise,</p>

<p>A trophy to her present praise;</p>

<p>Her that dares be</p>

<p>What these lines wish to see:</p>

<p>I seek no further, it is She.</p>

<p>'Tis She, and here</p>

<p>My Wishes cloudy character.</p>

<p>May she enjoy it</p>

<p>Whose merit dare apply it.</p>

<p>But modesty dares still deny it!</p>

<p>Such worth as this is Shall fix my flying Wishes, And determine them to kisses.</p>

<p>Let her full glory,</p>

<p>Be ye my fictions:but her story.</p>

<p>Upon the Book and Picture of the Seraphical Saint Teresa Live in these conquering leaves: live all the same; And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame; Live here, great heart; and love, and die, and kill: And bleed, and wound, and yield, and conquer still. Let this immortal life where'er it comes Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms. Let mystic deaths wait on't; and wise souls be The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee. O sweet incendiary! show here thy art Upon this carcase of a hard cold heart; Let all thy scatter'd shafts of light, that play</p>

<p>THOMAS JORDAN</p>

<p>Among the leaves of thy large books of day,</p>

<p>Combin'd against this breast at once break in,</p>

<p>And take away from me myself and sin;</p>

<p>This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be</p>

<p>And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.</p>

<p>O thou undaunted daughter of desires!</p>

<p>By all thy dower of lights and fires;</p>

<p>By all the eagle in thee, all the dove;</p>

<p>By all thy lives and deaths of love;</p>

<p>By thy large draughts of intellectual day,</p>

<p>And by thy thirsts of love more large than they;</p>

<p>By all thy brim-filled bowls of fierce desire,</p>

<p>By thy last morning's draught of liquid fire;</p>

<p>By the full kingdom of that final kiss</p>

<p>That seized thy parting soul, and sealed thee His;</p>

<p>By all the Heav'n thou hast in Him</p>

<p>THOMAS JORDAN [i6i2(?)-i68s]</p>

<p>Let us Drink and be Merry Let us drink and be merry, dance, joke, and rejoice, With claret and sherry, theorbo and voice! The changeable world to our joy is unjust,</p>

<p>All treasure's uncertain,</p>

<p>Then down with your dust! In frolics dispose your pounds, shillings, and pence, For we shall be nothing a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>We'll sport and be free with Moll, Betty, and Dolly, Have oysters and lobsters to cure melancholy: Fish-dinners will make a man spring like a flea,</p>

<p>Dame Venus, love's lady,</p>

<p>Was born of the sea: With her and with Bacchus we'll tickle the sense, For we shall be past it a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>ABRAHAM COWLEY 365</p>

<p>Your most beautiful bride who with garlands is crown'd And kills with each glance as she treads on the ground. Whose lightness and brightness doth shine in such splendour</p>

<p>That one but the stars</p>

<p>Are thought fit to attend her, Though now she be pleasant and sweet to the sense, Will be damnable mouldy a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>Then why should we turmoil in cares and in fears,</p>

<p>Turn all our tranquility to sighs and to tears?</p>

<p>Let's eat, drink, and play till the worms do corrupt us,</p>

<p>'Tis certain, Post mortem</p>

<p>Nulla voluptas. For health, wealth and beauty, wit, learning and sense, Must all come to nothing a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>ABRAHAM COWLEY [1618-1667}</p>

<p>A Supplication</p>

<p>Awake, awake, my Lyre! And tell thy silent master's humble tale</p>

<p>In sounds that may prevail; Sounds that gende thoughts inspire:</p>

<p>Though so exalted she</p>

<p>And I so lowly be Tell her, such different notes make all thy harmony.</p>

<p>Hark, how the strings awake: And, though the moving hand approach not near,</p>

<p>Themselves with awful fear A kind of numerous trembling make.</p>

<p>Now all thy forces try;</p>

<p>Now all thy charms apply; Revenge upon her ear the conquests of her eye.</p>

<p>Weak Lyre! thy virtue sure Is useless here, since thou art only found</p>

<p>To cure, but not to wound, And she to wound, but not to cure.</p>

<p>366</p>

<p>ABRAHAM COWLEY</p>

<p>Too weak too wilt thou prove My passion to remove; Physic to other ills, thou rt nourishment to love.</p>

<p>Sleep, sleep again, my Lyre! For thou canst never tell my humble tale</p>

<p>In sounds that will prevail, Nor gentle thoughts in her inspire;</p>

<p>All thy vain mirth lay by,</p>

<p>Bid thy strings silent lie, Sleep, sleep again, my Lyre, and let thy master die.</p>

<p>(Sitting and drinking in the chair made out of the relics of Sir Francis Drake's ship.)</p>

<p>Cheer up, my mates, the wind does fairly blow;</p>

<p>Clap on more sail, and never spare;</p>

<p>Farewell, all lands, for now we are</p>

<p>In the wide sea of drink, and merrily we go. Bless me, 'tis hot! another bowl of wine,</p>

<p>And we shall cut the burning Line: Hey, boys! she scuds away, and by my head I know</p>

<p>We round the world are sailing now. What dull men are those who tarry at home, When abroad they might wantonly roam,</p>

<p>And gain such experience, and spy, too,</p>

<p>Such countries and wonders, as I do! But pr'ythee, good pilot, take heed what you do,</p>

<p>And fail not to touch at Peru!</p>

<p>With gold there the vessel we'll store,</p>

<p>And never, and never be poor,</p>

<p>No, never be poor any more.</p>

<p>The thirsty earth soaks up the rain, And drinks and gapes for drink again; The plants suck in the earth, and are With constant drinking fresh and fair; The sea itself (which one would think</p>

<p>248</p>

<p>Cheer up, my Mates</p>

<p>249</p>

<p>Drinking</p>

<p>ABRAHAM COWLEY</p>

<p>Should have but little need of drink) Drinks twice ten thousand rivers up, So fill'd that they o'erflow the cup. The busy Sun (and one would guess By's drunken fiery face no less) Drinks up the sea, and when he's done, The Moon and Stars drink up the Sun: They drink and dance by their own light, They drink and revel all the night: Nothing in Nature's sober found, But an eternal health goes round. Fill up tfie bowl, then, fill it high, Fill all the glasses therefor why Should every creature drink but I ? Why, man of morals, tell me why?</p>

<p>On the Death of Mr. William Hervey</p>

<p>It was a dismal and a fearful night:</p>

<p>Scarce could the Morn drive on th' unwilling Light,</p>

<p>When Sleep, Death's image, left my troubled breast</p>

<p>By something liker Death possest. My eyes with tears did uncommanded flow,</p>

<p>And on my soul hung the dull weight</p>

<p>Of some intolerable fate. What bell was that? Ah me! too much I know!</p>

<p>My sweet companion and my gentle peer,</p>

<p>Why hast thou left me thus unkindly here,</p>

<p>Thy end for ever and my life to moan? O, thou hast left me all alone!</p>

<p>Thy soul and body, when death's agony Besieged around thy noble heart, Did not with more reluctance part</p>

<p>Than I, my dearest Friend, do part from thee.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend, would I had died for thee! Life and this world henceforth will tedious be: Nor shall I know hereafter what to do</p>

<p>If once my griefs prove tedious too. Silent and sad I walk about all day,</p>

<p>ABRAHAM COWLEY</p>

<p>As sullen ghosts stalk speechless by Where their hid treasures lie; Alas! my treasure's gone; why do I stay?</p>

<p>Say, for you saw us, ye immortal lights, How oft unwearied have we spent the nights, Till the Ledaean stars, so famed for love,</p>

<p>Wonder'd at us from above! We spent them not in toys, in lusts, or wine;</p>

<p>But search of deep Philosophy,</p>

<p>Wit, Eloquence, and Poetry Arts which I loved, for they, my Friend, were thine</p>

<p>Ye fields of Cambridge, our dear Cambridge, say</p>

<p>Have ye not seen us walking every day?</p>

<p>Was there a tree about which did not know The love betwixt us two?</p>

<p>Henceforth, ye gentle trees, for ever fade; Or your sad branches thicker join And into darksome shades combine,</p>

<p>Dark as the grave wherein my Friend is laid!</p>

<p>Large was his soul: as large a soul as e'er</p>

<p>Submitted to inform a body here;</p>

<p>High as the place 'twas shordy in Heaven to have.</p>

<p>But low and humble as his grave. So high that all the virtues there did come,</p>

<p>As to their chiefest seat</p>

<p>Conspicuous and great; So low, that for me too it made a room.</p>

<p>Knowledge he only sought, and so soon caught As if for him Knowledge had rather sought; Nor did more learning ever crowded lie</p>

<p>In such a short mortality. Whene'er the skilful youth discoursed or writ,</p>

<p>Still did the notions throng</p>

<p>About his eloquent tongue; Nor could his ink flow faster than his wit.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER BROME</p>

<p>His mirth was the pure spirits of various wit,</p>

<p>Yet never did his God or friends forget;</p>

<p>And when deep talk and wisdom came in view, Retired, and gave to them their due.</p>

<p>For the rich help of books he always took,</p>

<p>Though his own searching mind before Was so with notions written o'er,</p>

<p>As if wise Nature had made that her book.</p>

<p>With as much zeal, devotion, piety,</p>

<p>He always lived, as other saints do die.</p>

<p>Still with his soul severe account he kept, Weeping all debts out ere he slept.</p>

<p>Then down in peace and innocence he lay, Like the Sun's laborious light, Which still in water sets at night,</p>

<p>Unsullied with his journey of the day.</p>

<p>But happy Thou, ta'en from this frantic age,</p>

<p>Where ignorance and hypocrisy does rage!</p>

<p>A fitter time for Heaven no soul e'er chose The place now only free from those.</p>

<p>There 'mong the blest thou dost for ever shine; And whereso'er thou casts thy view Upon that white and radiant crew,</p>

<p>See'st not a soul clothed with more light than thine.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER BROME [1620-1666]</p>

<p>25/ The Resolve</p>

<p>Tell me not of a face that's fair,</p>

<p>Nor lip and cheek that's red, Nor of the tresses of her hair,</p>

<p>Nor curls in order laid, Nor of a rare seraphic voice</p>

<p>That like an angel sings; Though if I were to take my choice</p>

<p>I would have all these things: But if that thou wilt have me love,</p>

<p>369</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>And it must be a she, The only argument can move Is that she will love me.</p>

<p>The glories of your ladies be</p>

<p>But metaphors of things, And but resemble what we see</p>

<p>Each common object brings. Roses out-red their lips and cheeks,</p>

<p>Lilies their whiteness stain; What fool is he that shadows seeks</p>

<p>And may the substance gain? Then if thou'lt have me love a lass,</p>

<p>Let it be one that's kind: Else I'm a servant to the glass</p>

<p>That's with Canary lined.</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL [1621-1678]</p>

<p>A Garden</p>

<p>Written after the Civil Wars</p>

<p>See how the flowers, as at parade, Under their colours stand display'd: Each regiment in order grows, That of the tulip, pink, and rose. But when the vigilant patrol Of stars walks round about the pole, Their leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd, Seem to their staves the ensigns furl'd. Then in some flower's beloved hut Each bee, as sentinel, is shut, And sleeps so too; but if once stirr'd, She runs you through, nor asks the word. O thou, that dear and happy Isle, The garden of the world erewhile, Thou Paradise of the four seas Which Heaven planted us to please,</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>But, to exclude the world, did guard With wat'ry if not flaming sword; What luckless apple did we taste To make us mortal and thee waste! Unhappy! shall we never more That sweet militia restore, When gardens only had their towers, And all the garrisons were flowers; When roses only arms might bear, And men did rosy garlands wear?</p>

<p>The Picture of Little T. C. in a Prospect of Flowers</p>

<p>See with what simplicity This nymph begins her golden days! In the green grass she loves to lie, And there with her fair aspect tames The wilder flowers, and gives them names; But only with the roses plays,</p>

<p>And them does tell What colour best becomes them, and what smell.</p>

<p>Who can foretell for what high cause This darling of the gods was born? Yet this is she whose chaster laws The wanton Love shall one day fear, And, under her command severe, See his bow broke and ensigns torn.</p>

<p>Happy who can Appease this virtuous enemy of man!</p>

<p>O then let me in time compound And parley with those conquering eyes, Ere they have tried their force to wound; Ere with their glancing wheels they drive In triumph over hearts that strive, And them that yield but more despise: Let me be laid, Where I may see the glories from some shade.</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>Meantime, whilst every verdant thing Itself does at thy beauty charm, Reform the errors of the Spring; Make that the tulips may have share Of sweetness, seeing they are fair, And roses of their thorns disarm;</p>

<p>But most procure That violets may a longer age endure.</p>

<p>But O, young beauty of the woods, Whom Nature courts with fruits and flowers, Gather the flowers, but spare the buds; Lest Flora, angry at thy crime To kill her infants in their prime, Do quickly make th' example yours;</p>

<p>And ere we see, Nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee.</p>

<p>Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland The forward youth that would appear, Must now forsake his Muses dear, Nor in the shadows sing His numbers languishing.</p>

<p>'Tis time to leave the books in dust, And oil the unused armour's rust,</p>

<p>Removing from the wall</p>

<p>The corslet of the hall.</p>

<p>So restless Cromwell could not cease In the inglorious arts of peace,</p>

<p>But through adventurous war</p>

<p>Urged his active star:</p>

<p>And like the three-fork'd lightning, first Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,</p>

<p>Did thorough his own side</p>

<p>His fiery way divide:</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>For 'tis all one to courage high. The emulous, or enemy;</p>

<p>And with such, to enclose</p>

<p>Is more than to oppose;</p>

<p>Then burning through the air he went And palaces and temples rent; And Caesar's head at last Did through his laurels blast.</p>

<p>'Tis madness to resist or blame The face of angry heaven's flame:</p>

<p>And if we would speak true,</p>

<p>Much to the Man is due</p>

<p>Who, from his private gardens, where He lived reserved and austere,</p>

<p>(As if his highest plot</p>

<p>To plant the bergamot),</p>

<p>Could by industrious valour climb To ruin the great work of time,</p>

<p>And cast the Kingdoms old</p>

<p>Into another mould.</p>

<p>Though Justice against Fate complain, And plead the ancient Rights in vain But those do hold or break As men are strong or weak,</p>

<p>Nature, that hateth emptiness,</p>

<p>Allows of penetration less,</p>

<p>And therefore must make room Where greater spirits come.</p>

<p>What field of all the civil war Where his were not the deepest scar?</p>

<p>And Hampton shows what part</p>

<p>He had of wiser art,</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>Where, twining subtle fears with hope, He wove a net of such a scope</p>

<p>That Charles himself might chase To Carisbrook's narrow case,</p>

<p>That thence the Royal actor borne The tragic scaffold might adorn: While round the armed bands Did clap their bloody hands.</p>

<p>He nothing common did or mean Upon that memorable scene,</p>

<p>But with his keener eye</p>

<p>The axe's edge did try;</p>

<p>Nor call'd the Gods, with vulgar spite, To vindicate his helpless right</p>

<p>But bow'd his comely head</p>

<p>Down, as upon a bed.</p>

<p>This was that memorable hour Which first assured the forced power:</p>

<p>So when they did design</p>

<p>The Capitol's first line,</p>

<p>A Bleeding Head, where they begun, Did fright the architects to run;</p>

<p>And yet in that the State</p>

<p>Foresaw its happy fate!</p>

<p>And now the Irish are ashamed To see themselves in one year tamed: So much one man can do That does both act and know.</p>

<p>They can affirm his praises best, And have, though overcome, confest</p>

<p>How good he is, how just</p>

<p>And fit for highest trust;</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>Nor yet grown stiffer with command, But still in the Republic's hand</p>

<p>How fit he is to sway</p>

<p>That can so well obey!</p>

<p>He to the Commons' feet presents A Kingdom for his first year's rents, And (what he may) forbears His fame, to make it theirs:</p>

<p>And has his sword and spoils ungirt To lay them at the Public's skirt.</p>

<p>So when the falcon high</p>

<p>Falls heavy from the sky,</p>

<p>She, having kill'd, no more does search But on the next green bough to perch, Where, when he first does lure, The falconer has her sure.</p>

<p>What may not then our Isle presume While victory his crest does plume? What may not others fear If thus he crowns each year?</p>

<p>As Caesar he, ere long, to Gaul, To Italy an Hannibal,</p>

<p>And to all States not free</p>

<p>Shall climacteric be.</p>

<p>The Pict no shelter now shall find Within his parti-colour'd mind, But from this valour sad, Shrink underneath the plaid</p>

<p>Happy, if in the tufted brake The English hunter him mistake,</p>

<p>Nor lay his hounds in near</p>

<p>The Caledonian deer.</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>But Thou, the War's and Fortune's son,</p>

<p>March indefatigably on; And for the last effect Still keep the sword erect:</p>

<p>Besides the force it has to fright The spirits of the shady night, The same arts that did gain A power, must it maintain.</p>

<p>Song of the Emigrants in Bermuda</p>

<p>Where the remote Bermudas ride In the ocean's bosom unespied, From a small boat that row'd along The listening winds received this song:</p>

<p>'What should we do but sing His praise That led us through the watery maze Where He the huge sea-monsters wracks, That lift the deep upon their backs, Unto an isle so long unknown, And yet far kinder than our own? He lands us on a grassy stage, Safe from the storms, and prelate's rage: He gave us this eternal spring Which here enamels everything, And sends the fowls to us in care On daily visits through the air. He hangs in shades the orange bright Like golden lamps in a green night, And does in the pomegranates close Jewels more rich than Ormus shows: He makes the figs our mouths to meet And throws the melons at our feet; But apples plants of such a price, No tree could ever bear them twice. With cedars chosen by his hand From Lebanon he stores the land; And makes the hollow seas that roar Proclaim the ambergris on shore.</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>He cast (of which we rather boast) The Gospel's pearl upon our coast; And in these rocks for us did frame A temple where to sound His name. Oh! let our voice His praise exalt Till it arrive at Heaven's vault, Which then perhaps rebounding may Echo beyond the Mexique bay!' Thus sung they in the English boat A holy and a cheerful note: And all the way, to guide their chime, With falling oars they kept the time.</p>

<p>Thoughts in a Garden</p>

<p>How vainly men themselves amaze To win the palm, the oak, or bays, And their incessant labours see Crown'd from some single herb or tree, Whose short and narrow-verged shade Does prudently their toils upbraid; While all the flowers and trees do close To weave the garlands of Repose.</p>

<p>Fair Quiet, have I found thee here, And Innocence thy sister dear? Mistaken long, I sought you then In busy companies of men: Your sacred plants, if here below, Only among the plants will grow: Society is all but rude To this delicious solitude.</p>

<p>No white nor red was ever seen So amorous as this lovely green. Fond lovers, cruel as their flame, Cut in these trees their mistress' name: Little, alas, they know or heed How far these beauties her exceed! Fair trees! where'er your barks I wound, No name shall but your own be found.</p>

<p>ANDREW MARVELL</p>

<p>When we have run our passions' heat Love hither makes his best retreat: The gods, who mortal beauty chase, Still in a tree did end their race; Apollo hunted Daphne so Only that she might laurel grow; And Pan did after Syrinx speed Not as a nymph, but for a reed.</p>

<p>What wondrous life is this I lead! Ripe apples drop about my head; The luscious clusters of the vine Upon my mouth do crush their wine; The nectarine and curious peach Into my hands themselves do reach; Stumbling on melons, as I pass, Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less</p>

<p>Withdraws into its happiness;</p>

<p>The mind, that ocean where each kind</p>

<p>Does straight its own resemblance find;</p>

<p>Yet it creates, transcending these,</p>

<p>Far other worlds, and other seas;</p>

<p>Annihilating all that's made</p>

<p>To a green thought in a green shade.</p>

<p>Here at the fountain's sliding foot Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root, Casting the body's vest aside My soul into the boughs does glide; There, like a bird, it sits and sings, Then whets and claps its silver wings, And, till prepared for longer flight, Waves in its plumes the various light.</p>

<p>Such was that happy Garden-state While man there walk'd without a mate: After a place so pure and sweet, What other help could yet be meet!</p>

<p>LOVE WILL FIND OUT THE WAY</p>

<p>But 'twas beyond a mortal's share To wander solitary there: Two paradises 'twere in one, To live in Paradise alone.</p>

<p>How well the skilful gardener drew Of flowers and herbs this dial new! Where, from above, the milder sun Does through a fragrant zodiac run: And, as it works, th' industrious bee Computes its time as well as we. How could such sweet and wholesome hours Be reckon'd, but with herbs and flowers!</p>

<p>ANONYMOUS</p>

<p>Love Will Find Out the Way</p>

<p>Over the mountains And over the waves, Under the fountains And under the graves; Under floods that are deepest, Which Neptune obey; Over rocks that are steepest Love will find out the way.</p>

<p>Where there is no place</p>

<p>For the glow-worm to lie;</p>

<p>Where there is no space</p>

<p>For receipt of a fly;</p>

<p>Where the midge dares not venture</p>

<p>Lest herself fast she lay;</p>

<p>If love come, he will enter</p>

<p>And soon find out his way.</p>

<p>You may esteem him</p>

<p>A child for his might;</p>

<p>Or you may deem him</p>

<p>A coward from his flight;</p>

<p>But if she whom love doth honour</p>

<p>ANONYMOUS</p>

<p>Be conceal'd from the day,</p>

<p>Set a thousand guards upon her,</p>

<p>Love will find out the way.</p>

<p>Some think to lose him By having him confined; And some do suppose him, Poor thing, to be blind; But if ne'er so close ye wall him, Do the best that you may, Blind love, if so ye call him, Will find out his way.</p>

<p>You may train the eagle To stoop to your fist; Or you may inveigle The phoenix of the east; The lioness, ye may move her To give o'er her prey; But you'll ne'er stop a lover: He will find out his way.</p>

<p>Phillada Flouts Me</p>

<p>O what a plague is love!</p>

<p>How shall I bear it? She will inconstant prove,</p>

<p>I greatly fear it. She so torments my mind</p>

<p>That my strength faileth, And wavers with the wind</p>

<p>As a ship saileth. Please her the best I may, She loves still to gainsay; Alack and well-a-day!</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>At the fair yesterday</p>

<p>She did pass by me; She look'd another way</p>

<p>And would not spy me:</p>

<p>PHILLADA FLOUTS ME</p>

<p>I woo'd her for to dine,</p>

<p>But could not get her; Will had her to the wine</p>

<p>He might entreat her. With Daniel she did dance, On me she look'd askance:</p>

<p>0 thrice unhappy chance! Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>Fair maid, be not so coy, Do not disdain me!</p>

<p>1 am my mother's joy: Sweet, entertain me!</p>

<p>She'll give me, when she dies,</p>

<p>All that is fitting: Her poultry and her bees,</p>

<p>And her goose sitting, A pair of mattrass beds, And a bag full of shreds; And yet, for all this guedes,</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>She hath a clout of mine</p>

<p>Wrought with blue Coventry, Which she keeps for a sign</p>

<p>Of my fidelity: But i' faith, if she flinch</p>

<p>She shall not wear it; To Tib, my t'other wench,</p>

<p>I mean to bear it. And yet it grieves my heart So soon from her to part: Death strike me with his dart!</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>Thou shalt eat crudded cream</p>

<p>All the year lasting, And drink the crystal stream</p>

<p>Pleasant in tasting; Whig and whey whilst thou lust,</p>

<p>ANONYMOUS</p>

<p>And bramble-berries, Pie-lid and pastry-crust,</p>

<p>Pears, plums, and cherries. Thy raiment shall be thin, Made of a weevil's skin Yet all's not worth a pin!</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>In the last month of May</p>

<p>I made her posies; I heard her often say</p>

<p>That she loved roses. Cowslips and gillyflowers</p>

<p>And the white lily I brought to deck the bowers</p>

<p>For my sweet Philly. But she did all disdain, And threw them back again; Therefore 'tis flat and plain</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>Fair maiden, have a care,</p>

<p>And in time take me; I can have those as fair</p>

<p>If you forsake me: For Doll the dairy-maid</p>

<p>Laugh'd at me lately, And wanton Winifred</p>

<p>Favours me greatly. One throws milk on my clothes, T'other plays with my nose; What wanting signs are those?</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>I cannot work nor sleep</p>

<p>At all in season: Love wounds my heart so deep</p>

<p>Without all reason. I 'gin to pine away</p>

<p>In my love's shadow,</p>

<p>SIR CHARLES SEDLEY 383</p>

<p>Like as a fat beast may,</p>

<p>Penn'd in a meadow. I shall be dead, I fear, Within this thousand year: And all for that my dear</p>

<p>Phillada flouts me.</p>

<p>EARL OF ROCHESTER [1647-1680]</p>

<p>259 Epitaph on Charles II</p>

<p>Here lies our Sovereign Lord the King, Whose word no man relies on,</p>

<p>Who never said a foolish thing, Nor ever did a wise one.</p>

<p>SIR CHARLES SEDLEY [i639(?)-i7o,]</p>

<p>260 Chloris</p>

<p>Ah, Chloris! could I now but sit</p>

<p>As unconcern'd as when Your infant beauty could beget</p>

<p>No happiness or pain! When I the dawn used to admire,</p>

<p>And praised the coming day, I litde thought the rising fire</p>

<p>Would take my rest away.</p>

<p>Your charms in harmless childhood lay</p>

<p>Like metals in a mine; Age from no face takes more away</p>

<p>Than youth conceal'd in thine. But as your charms insensibly</p>

<p>To their perfection prest, So love as unperceived did fly,</p>

<p>And center'd in my breast.</p>

<p>384 JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>261 Celia</p>

<p>Not, Celia, that I juster am</p>

<p>Or better than the rest; For I would change each hour, like them,</p>

<p>Were not my heart at rest.</p>

<p>But I am tied to very thee By every thought I have;</p>

<p>Thy face I only care to see, Thy heart I only crave.</p>

<p>All that in woman is adored In thy dear self I find</p>

<p>For the whole sex can but afford The handsome and the kind.</p>

<p>Why then should I seek further store,</p>

<p>And still make love anew? When change itself can give no more,</p>

<p>'Tis easy to be true.</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN [1631-1700]</p>

<p>262 Ode</p>

<p>To the Pious Memory of the accomplished young lady, Mrs. Anne Killigrew, excellent in the two sister arts of Poesy and Painting</p>

<p>Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies, Made in the last promotion of the blest; Whose palms, new pluck'd from Paradise,</p>

<p>My passion with your beauty grew,</p>

<p>While Cupid at my heart Still as his mother favour'd you</p>

<p>Threw a new flaming dart: Each gloried in their wanton part;</p>

<p>To make a lover, he Employ'd the utmost of his art</p>

<p>To make a beauty, she.</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>In spreading branches more sublimely rise, Rich with immortal green above the rest:</p>

<p>Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,</p>

<p>Thou roll'st above us, in thy wandering race, Or, in procession fix'd and regular, Moved with the heaven's majestic pace; Or, call'd to more superior bliss,</p>

<p>Thou tread'st with seraphims the vast abyss:</p>

<p>Whatever happy region be thy place,</p>

<p>Cease thy celestial song a little space;</p>

<p>Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine, Since Heaven's eternal year is thine.</p>

<p>Hear, then, a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse, In no ignoble verse;</p>

<p>But such as thy own voice did practise here,</p>

<p>When thy first-fruits of Poesy were given,</p>

<p>To make thyself a welcome inmate there; While yet a young probationer, And candidate of heaven.</p>

<p>If by traduction came thy mind,</p>

<p>Our wonder is the less, to find A soul so charming from a stock so good; Thy father was transfused into thy blood: So wert thou born into a tuneful strain, An early, rich, and inexhausted vein.</p>

<p>But if thy pre-existing soul</p>

<p>Was form'd at first with myriads more, It did through all the mighty poets roll</p>

<p>Who Greek or Latin laurels wore, And was that Sappho last, which once it was before.</p>

<p>If so, then cease thy flight, O heaven-born mind! Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore:</p>

<p>Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find,</p>

<p>Than was the beauteous frame she left behind: Return, to fill or mend the quire of thy celestial kind.</p>

<p>May we presume to say, that, at thy birth, New joy was sprung in heaven as well as here on earth?</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>For sure the milder planets did combine</p>

<p>On thy auspicious horoscope to shine,</p>

<p>And even the most malicious were in trine.</p>

<p>Thy brother-angels at thy birth</p>

<p>Strung each his lyre, and tuned it high,</p>

<p>That all the people of the sky Might know a poetess was born on earth;</p>

<p>And then, if ever, mortal ears</p>

<p>Had heard the music of the spheres.</p>

<p>And if no clustering swarm of bees On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew,</p>

<p>'Twas that such vulgar miracles</p>

<p>Heaven had not leisure to renew: For all the blest fraternity of love Solemnized there thy birth, and kept thy holiday above.</p>

<p>O gracious God! how far have we Profaned thy heavenly gift of Poesy! Made prostitute and profligate the Muse, Debased to each obscene and impious use, Whose harmony was first ordain'd above, For tongues of angels and for hymns of love! O wretched we! why were we hurried down</p>

<p>This lubrique and adulterate age (Nay, added fat pollutions of our own),</p>

<p>To increase the streaming ordures of the stage?</p>

<p>What can we say to excuse our second fall?</p>

<p>Let this thy Vestal, Heaven, atone for all! Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,</p>

<p>Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefiled; Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child.</p>

<p>Art she had none, yet wanted none, For Nature did that want supply: So rich in treasures of her own, She might our boasted stores defy: Such noble vigour did her verse adorn, That it seem'd borrow'd, where 'twas only born. Her morals, too, were in her bosom bred, By great examples daily fed,</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN 387</p>

<p>What in the best of books, her father's life, she read. And to be read herself she need not fear; Each test, and every light, her Muse will bear, Though Epictetus with his lamp were there. Even love (for love sometimes her Muse exprest) Was but a lambent flame which play'd about her breast, Light as the vapours of a morning dream; So cold herself, whilst she such warmth exprest, 'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream. . . .</p>

<p>Now all those charms, that blooming grace, The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face, Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes; In earth the much-lamented virgin lies. Not wit, nor piety could fate prevent; Nor was the cruel destiny content To finish all the murder at a blow, To sweep at once her life and beauty too; But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride</p>

<p>To work more mischievously slow,</p>

<p>And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd. O double sacrilege on things divine,</p>

<p>To rob the relic, and deface the shrine! But thus Orinda died:</p>

<p>Heaven, by the same disease did both translate; As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate.</p>

<p>Meantime, her warlike brother on the seas</p>

<p>His waving streamers to the winds displays, And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays. Ah, generous youth! that wish forbear, The winds too soon will waft thee here! Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,</p>

<p>Alas! thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at home!</p>

<p>No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,</p>

<p>Thou hast already had her last embrace.</p>

<p>But look aloft, and if thou kenn'st from far,</p>

<p>Among the Pleiads a new kindled star,</p>

<p>If any sparkles than the rest more bright,</p>

<p>'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>When in mid-air the golden trump shall sound,</p>

<p>To raise the nations under ground; When, in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, The judging God shall close the book of Fate,</p>

<p>And there the last assizes keep</p>

<p>For those who wake and those who sleep;</p>

<p>When rattling bones together fly</p>

<p>From the four corners of the sky; When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread, Those clothed with flesh, and life inspires the dead; The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,</p>

<p>And foremost from the tomb shall bound, For they are cover'd with the lightest ground; And straight, with inborn vigour, on the wing, Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing. There thou, sweet Saint, before the quire shall go, As harbinger of Heaven, the way to show, The way which thou so well hast learn'd below.</p>

<p>Song to a Fair Young Lady, going out of the Town in the Spring</p>

<p>Ask not the cause why sullen Spring So long delays her flowers to bear;</p>

<p>Why warbling birds forget to sing, And winter storms invert the year:</p>

<p>Chloris is gone; and fate provides</p>

<p>To make it Spring where she resides.</p>

<p>Chloris is gone, the cruel fair;</p>

<p>She cast not back a pitying eye: But left her lover in despair</p>

<p>To sigh, to languish, and to die: Ah! how can those fair eyes endure To give the wounds they will not cure?</p>

<p>Great God of Love, why hast thou made A face that can all hearts command,</p>

<p>That all religions can invade,</p>

<p>And change the laws of every land?</p>

<p>Where thou hadst placed such power before, Thou shouldst have made her mercy more.</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>When Chloris to the temple comes, Adoring crowds before her fall;</p>

<p>She can restore the dead from tombs And every life but mine recall.</p>

<p>I only am by Love design'd</p>

<p>To be the victim for mankind.</p>

<p>Song for St. Cecilia's Day [1687]</p>

<p>From Harmony, from heavenly Harmony</p>

<p>This universal frame began: When Nature underneath a heap</p>

<p>Of jarring atoms lay And could not heave her head, The tuneful voice was heard from high,</p>

<p>'Arise, ye more than dead!' Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry In order to their stations leap,</p>

<p>And Music's power obey.</p>

<p>From harmony, from heavenly harmony</p>

<p>This universal frame began:</p>

<p>From harmony to harmony Through all the compass of the notes it ran, The diapason closing full in Man.</p>

<p>What passion cannot Music raise and quell? When Jubal struck the chorded shell His listening brethren stood around,</p>

<p>And, wondering, on their faces fell To worship that celestial sound. Less than a god they thought there could not Within the hollow of that shell That spoke so sweetly and so well. What passion cannot Music raise and quell?</p>

<p>The trumpet's loud clangor</p>

<p>Excites us to arms, With shrill notes of anger</p>

<p>And mortal alarms.</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>The double double double beat Of the thundering drum Cries 'Hark! the foes come; Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat!'</p>

<p>The soft complaining flute In dying notes discovers The woes of hopeless lovers, Whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling lute.</p>

<p>Sharp violins proclaim Their jealous pangs and desperation, Fury, frantic indignation, Depth of pains, and height of passion</p>

<p>For the fair disdainful dame.</p>

<p>But oh! what art can teach, What human voice can reach</p>

<p>The sacred organ's praise? Notes inspiring holy love, Notes that wing their heavenly ways</p>

<p>To mend the choirs above.</p>

<p>Orpheus could lead the savage race, And trees unrooted left their place</p>

<p>Sequacious of the lyre: But bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher; When to her Organ vocal breath was given An Angel heard, and straight appear'd</p>

<p>Mistaking Earth for Heaven.</p>

<p>Grand Chorus</p>

<p>As from the power of sacred lays</p>

<p>The spheres began to move, And sung the great Creator's praise</p>

<p>To all the blest above; So when the last and dreadful hour This crumbling pageant shall devour, The trumpet shall be heard on high, The dead shall live, the living die, And Music shall untune the sky.</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>Alexander's Feast or the power of music; an ode in honor of st. Cecilia's day</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>T was at the royal feast, for Persia won By Philip's warlike son: Aloft in awful state The godlike hero sate On his imperial throne: His valiant peers were plac'd around; Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound: (So should desert in arms be crown'd.) The lovely Thais, by his side, Sate like a blooming Eastern bride In flow'r of youth and beauty's pride. Happy, happy, happy pair! None but the brave, None but the brave, None but the brave deserves the fair!</p>

<p>Chorus Happy, happy, happy pair! None but the brave, None but the brave, None but the brave deserves the fair!</p>

<p>ir</p>

<p>Timotheus, plac'd on high Amid the tuneful choir, With flying fingers touch'd the lyre: The trembling notes ascend the sky, And heav'nly joys inspire. The song began from Jove, Who left his blissful seats above, Such is the pow'r of mighty love. A dragon's fiery form belied the god: Sublime on radiant spires he rode, When he to fair Olympia press'd;</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>And while he sought her snowy breast: Then, round her slender waist he curl'd, And stamp'd an image of himself, a sov'reign of the world.</p>

<p>The list'ning crowd admire the lofty sound;</p>

<p>"A present deity," they shout around;</p>

<p>"A present deity," the vaulted roofs rebound:</p>

<p>With ravish'd ears</p>

<p>The monarch hears,</p>

<p>Assumes the god,</p>

<p>Affects to nod,</p>

<p>And seems to shake the spheres.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>With ravish'd ears The monarch hears. Assumes the god, Affects to nod,</p>

<p>And seems to shake the spheres. in</p>

<p>The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,</p>

<p>Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young: The jolly god in triumph comes; Sound the trumpets; beat the drums; Flush'd with a purple grace He shews his honest face:</p>

<p>Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes.</p>

<p>Bacchus, ever fair and young,</p>

<p>Drinking joys did first ordain;</p>

<p>Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,</p>

<p>Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:</p>

<p>Rich the treasure,</p>

<p>Sweet the pleasure,</p>

<p>Sweet is pleasure after pain.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Bacchus' blessings are a treasure, Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN Rich the treasure, Sweet the pleasure, Sweet is pleasure after pain.</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>Sooth'd with the sound, the king grew vain; Fought all his battles o'er again; And thrice he routed all his foes; and thrice he</p>

<p>slew the slain. The master saw the madness rise; His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes; And, while he heav'n and earth defied, Chang'd his hand, and check'd his pride. He chose a mournful Muse, Soft pity to infuse. He sung Darius great and good, By too severe a fate, Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen, Fallen from his high estate, And welt'ring in his blood; Deserted, at his utmost need, By those his former bounty fed; On the bare earth expos'd he lies, With not a friend to close his eyes.</p>

<p>With downcast looks the joyless victor sate, Revolving in his alter'd soul The various turns of chance below; And, now and then, a sigh he stole; And tears began to flow.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Revolving in his alter'd soul The various turns of chance below; And, now and then, a sigh he stole; And tears began to flow.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>The mighty master smil'd, to see That love was in the next degree:</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN</p>

<p>'T was but a kindred-sound to move, For pity melts the mind to love. Softly sweet, in Lydian measures, Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures. "War," he sung, "is toil and trouble; Honor, but an empty bubble; Never ending, still beginning, Fighting still, and still destroying: If the world be worth thy winning, Think, O think it worth enjoying; Lovely Thais sits beside thee, Take the good the gods provide thee."</p>

<p>The many rend the skies with loud applause;</p>

<p>So love was crown'd, but Music won the cause.</p>

<p>The prince, unable to conceal his pain,</p>

<p>Gaz'd on the fair</p>

<p>Who caus'd his care,</p>

<p>And sigh'd and look'd, sigh'd and look'd,</p>

<p>Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again:</p>

<p>At length, with love and wine at once oppress'd,</p>

<p>The vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>The prince, unable to conceal his pain, Gaz'd on the fair Who caus'd his care,</p>

<p>And sigh'd and loo\'d, sigh'd and look'd, Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again: At length, with love and wine at once oppress'd, The vanquish'd victor sunk^ upon her breast.</p>

<p>vi</p>

<p>Now strike the golden lyre again: A louder yet, and yet a louder strain. Break his bands of sleep asunder, And rouse him, like a rattling peal of thunder. Hark, hark, the horrid sound Has rais'd up his head:</p>

<p>JOHN DRYDEN 395</p>

<p>As awak'd from the dead,</p>

<p>And amaz'd, he stares around.</p>

<p>"Revenge, revenge!" Timotheus cries,</p>

<p>"See the Furies arise!</p>

<p>See the snakes that they rear,</p>

<p>How they hiss in their hair,</p>

<p>And the sparkles that flash from their eyes!</p>

<p>Behold a ghastly band,</p>

<p>Each a torch in his hand!</p>

<p>Those are Grecian ghosts, that in batde were slain, And unburied remain Inglorious on the plain: Give the vengeance due To the valiant crew.</p>

<p>Behold how they toss their torches on high,</p>

<p>How they point to the Persian abodes,</p>

<p>And glitt'ring temples of their hostile gods!"</p>

<p>The princes applaud, with a furious joy;</p>

<p>And the king seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to destroy;</p>

<p>Thais led the way,</p>

<p>To light him to his prey,</p>

<p>And, like another Helen, fir'd another Troy.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>And the king seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to destroy;</p>

<p>Thais led the way,</p>

<p>To light him to his prey,</p>

<p>And, like another Helen, fir'd another Troy.</p>

<p>Thus, long ago,</p>

<p>Ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow, While organs yet were mute; Timotheus, to his breathing flute, And sounding lyre,</p>

<p>Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.</p>

<p>At last, divine Cecilia came,</p>

<p>Inventress of the vocal frame;</p>

<p>The sweet enthusiast, from her sacred store,</p>

<p>MATTHEW PRIOR</p>

<p>Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds,</p>

<p>And added length to solemn sounds,</p>

<p>With nature's mother wit, and arts unknown before.</p>

<p>Let old Timotheus yield the prize,</p>

<p>Or both divide the crown;</p>

<p>He rais'd a mortal to the skies;</p>

<p>She drew an angel down.</p>

<p>To a Child of Quality Five Years Old, 1704. The Author then Forty</p>

<p>Lords, knights, and squires, the numerous band That wear the fair Miss Mary's fetters,</p>

<p>Were summoned by her high command To show their passions by their letters.</p>

<p>MATTHEW PRIOR</p>

<p>My pen amongst the rest I took,</p>

<p>Lest those bright eyes, that cannot read,</p>

<p>Should dart their kindling fires, and look The power they have to be obey'd.</p>

<p>Nor quality, nor reputation,</p>

<p>Forbid me yet my flame to tell; Dear Five-years-old befriends my passion,</p>

<p>And I may write till she can spell.</p>

<p>For, while she makes her silkworm beds With all the tender things I swear;</p>

<p>Whilst all the house my passion reads, In papers round her baby's hair;</p>

<p>She may receive and own my flame;</p>

<p>For, though the strictest prudes should know She'll pass for a most virtuous dame,</p>

<p>And I for an unhappy poet.</p>

<p>Then, too, alas! when she shall tear The rhymes some younger rival sends,</p>

<p>She'll give me leave to write, I fear, And we shall still continue friends.</p>

<p>My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,</p>

<p>Fair Cloe blush'd: Euphelia frown'd:</p>

<p>Love in Her Eyes Sits Playing</p>

<p>Love in her eyes sits playing,</p>

<p>And sheds delicious death; Love in her lips is straying,</p>

<p>And warbling in her breath; Love on her breast sits panting,</p>

<p>And swells with soft desire: Nor grace, nor charm, is wanting</p>

<p>To set the heart on fire.</p>

<p>Black-Eyed Susan</p>

<p>All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd,</p>

<p>The streamers waving in the wind, When black-eyed Susan came aboard;</p>

<p>'O! where shall I my true-love find? Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true If my sweet William sails among the crew.'</p>

<p>William, who high upon the yard</p>

<p>Rock'd with the billow to and fro, Soon as her well-known voice he heard</p>

<p>He sigh'd, and cast his eyes below: The cord slides swifdy through his glowing hands, And quick as lightning on the deck he stands.</p>

<p>So the sweet lark, high poised in air,</p>

<p>Shuts close his pinions to his breast If chance his mate's shrill call he hear,</p>

<p>And drops at once into her nest: The noblest captain in the British fleet Might envy William's lip those kisses sweet.</p>

<p>'O Susan, Susan, lovely dear,</p>

<p>My vows shall ever true remain; Let me kiss off that falling tear;</p>

<p>We only part to meet again.</p>

<p>They'll tell thee, sailors, when away, In every port a mistress find:</p>

<p>Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,</p>

<p>For Thou art present wheresoe'er I go.</p>

<p>'If to fair India's coast we sail,</p>

<p>Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright,</p>

<p>Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale, Thy skin is ivory so white.</p>

<p>Thus every beauteous object that I view</p>

<p>Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.</p>

<p>'Though batde call me from thy arms</p>

<p>Let not my pretty Susan mourn; Though cannons roar, yet safe from harms</p>

<p>William shall to his Dear return. Love turns aside the balls that round me fly, Lest precious tears should drop from Susan's eye:</p>

<p>The boatswain gave the dreadful word, The sails their swelling bosom spread,</p>

<p>No longer must she stay aboard;</p>

<p>They kiss'd, she sigh'd, he hung his head.</p>

<p>Her lessening boat unwilling rows to land; 'Adieu!' she cries; and waved her lily hand.</p>

<p>So sweet a girl as Sally! She is the darling of my heart,</p>

<p>And often am I blamed Because I leave him in the lurch</p>

<p>Make game of me and Sally, And, but for her, I'd better be</p>

<p>Blest, who can unconcern'dly find Hours, days, and years, slide soft away In health of body, peace of mind, Quiet by day.</p>

<p>Handsome and witty, yet a friend.</p>

<p>Not warped by passion, awed by rumour,</p>

<p>Not grave through pride, or gay through folly;</p>

<p>An equal mixture of good humour, And sensible soft melancholy.</p>

<p>The woman's deaf, and does not hear!</p>

<p>AN ESSAY ON MAN To H. St. John, L. Bolingbroke</p>

<p>THE DESIGN</p>

<p>Having proposed to write some pieces on human life and manners, such as (to use my lord Bacon's expression) came home to men's business and bosoms, I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering Man in the abstract, his nature and his state; since, to prove any moral duty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in, and what is the proper end and purpose of its being.</p>

<p>The science of human nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a few clear points: there are not many certain truths in this world. It is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels, the con-</p>

<p>Thus let me live, unseen, unknown; Thus unlamented let me die; Steal from the world, and not a stone Tell where I lie.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE 407</p>

<p>formations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation. The disputes are all upon these last, and I will venture to say, they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other, and have diminished the practice, more than advanced the theory of morality. If I could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit, it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite, in passing over terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent, and a short yet not imperfect, system of ethics.</p>

<p>This I might have done in prose; but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for two reasons. The one will appear obvious; that principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first, and are more easily retained by him afterwards: the other may seem odd, but it is true; I found I could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself; and nothing is more certain, than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness. I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail, without becoming dry and tedious; or more poetically, without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandering from the precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning. If any man can unite all these without any diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity.</p>

<p>What is now published, is only to be considered as a general map of Man, marking out no more than the greater parts, their extent, their limits, and their connection, but leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow. Consequently, these Epistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any progress) will be less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament. I am here only opening the fountains, and clearing the passage. To deduce the rivers, to follow them in their course, and to observe their effects, may be a task more agreeable.</p>

<p>Epistle IOp the nature and state of man, with respect to the</p>

<p>universe</p>

<p>Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things</p>

<p>To low ambition, and the pride of kings.</p>

<p>Let us (since life can little more supply</p>

<p>Than just to look about us, and to die)</p>

<p>Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;</p>

<p>A mighty maze! but not without a plan;</p>

<p>A wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit. Together let us beat this ample field, Try what the open, what the covert yield! The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar; Eye nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies, And catch the manners living as they rise: Laugh where we must, be candid where we can; But vindicate the ways of God to man.</p>

<p>I. Say first, of God above, or man below, What can we reason, but from what we know? Of man, what see we but his station here, From which to reason, or to which refer?</p>

<p>Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,</p>

<p>'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.</p>

<p>He, who thro' vast immensity can pierce,</p>

<p>See worlds on worlds compose one universe,</p>

<p>Observe how system into system runs,</p>

<p>What other planets circle other suns.</p>

<p>What vary'd being peoples every star,</p>

<p>May tell why heav'n has made us as we are.</p>

<p>But of this frame the bearings and the ties,</p>

<p>The strong connections, nice dependencies,</p>

<p>Gradations just, has thy pervading soul</p>

<p>Look'd thro' or can a part contain the whole?</p>

<p>Is the great chain, that draws all to agree, And drawn support, upheld by God, or thee?</p>

<p>II. Presumptuous man! the reason wouldst thou find, Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?</p>

<p>First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess, Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less? Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade? Or ask of yonder argent fields above, Why Jove's Satellites are less than Jove?</p>

<p>Of systems possible, if 'tis confest That wisdom infinite must form the best, Where all must full or not coherent be, And all that rises, rise in due degree; Then, in the scale of reas'ning life, 'tis plain,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE 409</p>

<p>There must be, somewhere, such a rank as man: And all the question (wrangle e'er so long) Is only this, if God has plac'd him wrong?</p>

<p>Respecting man whatever wrong we call, May, must be right, as relative to all. In human works, tho' labour'd on with pain, A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain; In God's, one single can its end produce; Yet serves to second too some other use. So man, who here seems principal alone, Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown, Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal; 'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.</p>

<p>When the proud steed shall know why man restrains His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains; When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod, Is now a victim, and now ^Egypt's god: Then shall man's pride and dullness comprehend His actions', passions', being's, use and end; Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why This hour a slave, the next a deity.</p>

<p>Then say not man's imperfect, heav'n in fault; Say rather, man's as perfect as he ought: His knowledge measur'd to his state and place; His time a moment, and a point his space. If to be perfect in a certain sphere, What matter, soon or late, or here or there? The blest to-day is as completely so, As who began a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>III.   Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate, All but the page prescrib'd, their present state: From brutes what men, from men what spirits know: Or who could suffer being here below? The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day, Had he thy reason, would he skip and play? Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food, And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood. Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n, That each may fill the circle mark'd by heav'n: Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,</p>

<p>Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,</p>

<p>And now a bubble burst, and now a world.</p>

<p>Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar; Wait the great teacher death, and God adore. What future bliss, he gives not thee to know, But gives that hope to be thy blessing now. Hope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never is, but always to be blest: The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home, Rests and expatiates in a life to come.</p>

<p>Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind; His soul, proud science never taught to stray Far as the solar walk, or milky way; Yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n, Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heav'n; Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd, Some happier island in the wat'ry waste, Where slaves once more their native land behold, No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold. To Be, contents his natural desire, He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire; But thinks admitted to that equal sky, His faithful dog shall bear him company.</p>

<p>IV.   Go, wiser thou! and in thy scale of sense, Weigh thy opinion against providence; Call imperfection what thou fancy'st such, Say, here he gives too little, there too much: Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust, Yet cry, If man's unhappy, God's unjust; If man alone ingross not Heav'n's high care, Alone made perfect here, immortal there: Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod, Re-judge his justice, be the God of God. In pride, in reas'ning pride, our error lies; All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies. Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes, Men would be angels, angels would be gods. Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Aspiring to be angels, men rebel:</p>

<p>And who but wishes to invert the laws</p>

<p>Of order, sins against th' eternal cause.</p>

<p>V.  Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine, Earth for whose use? pride answers, ' 'Tis for mine: For me kind nature wakes her genial pow'r, Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'r; Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew; For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings; For me, health gushes from a thousand springs; Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise; My foot-stool earth, my canopy the skies.'</p>

<p>But errs not nature from this gracious end, From burning suns when livid deaths descend, When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep? 'No ('tis reply'd) the first almighty cause Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws; Th' exceptions few; some change since all began: And what created perfect?'Why then man? If the great end be human happiness, Then nature deviates; and can man do less? As much that end a constant course requires Of show'rs and sunshine, as of man's desires; As much eternal springs and cloudless skies, As men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise. If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n's design, Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline? Who knows but he, whose hand the lightning forms, Who heaves old ocean, and who wings the storms; Pours fierce ambition in a Caesar's mind, Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind? From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs; Account for moral as for nat'ral things: Why charge we heav'n in those, in these acquit? In both, to reason right is to submit.</p>

<p>Better for us, perhaps, it might appear, Were there all harmony, all virtue here; That never air or ocean felt the wind,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>That never passion discompos'd the mind. But all subsists by elemental strife; And passions are the elements of life. The gen'ral order, since the whole began, Is kept in nature, and is kept in man.</p>

<p>VI. What would this man? Now upward will he And little less than angel, would be more;</p>

<p>Now looking downwards, just as griev'd appears To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears. Made for his use all creatures if he call, Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all; Nature to these, without profusion, kind, The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd; Each seeming want compensated of course, Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force; All in exact proportion to the state; Nothing to add, and nothing to abate. Each beast, each insect, happy in its own: Is Heav'n unkind to man, and man alone? Shall he alone, whom rational we call, Be pleas'd with nothing, if not blest with all?</p>

<p>The bliss of man (could pride that blessing find) Is not to act or think beyond mankind; No pow'rs of body, or of soul to share, But what his nature and his state can bear. Why has not man a microscopic eye? For this plain reason, man is not a fly. Say what the use, were finer optics giv'n, T inspect a mite, not comprehend the heav'n? Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er, To smart and agonize at ev'ry pore? Or, quick effluvia darting thro' the brain, Die of a rose in aromatic pain? If nature thunder'd in his op'ning ears, And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres, How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still The whisp'ring zephyr, and the purling rill! Who finds not Providence all good and wise, Alike in what it gives, and what denies?</p>

<p>VII. Far as creation's ample range extends,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends: Mark how it mounts to man's imperial race, From the green myriads in the peopled grass: What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme, The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam: Of smell, the headlong lioness between, And hound sagacious on the tainted green: Of hearing, from the life that fills the flood, To that which warbles through the vernal wood ? The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine! Feels at each thread, and lives along the line: In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew: How instinct varies in the grov'ling swine, Compar'd, half reas'ning elephant, with thine! 'Twixt that, and reason, what a nice barrier? For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near! Remembrance and reflection how ally'd; What thin partitions sense from thought divide? And middle natures, how they long to join, Yet never pass th' insuperable line! Without this just gradation, could they be Subjected, these to those, or all to thee? The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone, Is not thy reason all these pow'rs in one?</p>

<p>VIII.   See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth, All matter quick, and bursting into birth. Above, how high progressive life may go! Around, how wide! how deep extend below! Vast chain of being! which from God began, Natures aethereal, human, angel, man, Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see, No glass can reach; from infinite to thee, From thee to nothing. On superior pow'rs Were we to press, inferior might on ours; Or in the full creation leave a void, Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd: From Nature's chain whatever link you strike, Tenth, or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.</p>

<p>And, if each system in gradation roll</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Alike essential to th' amazing whole, The least confusion but in one, not all That system only, but the whole must fall. Let earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly, Planets and suns run lawless thro' the sky; Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurl'd, Being on being wreck'd, and world on world; Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod, And nature tremble to the throne of God. All this dread order breakfor whom? for thee? Vile worm!oh madness! pride! impiety!</p>

<p>IX.   What if the foot, ordain'd the dust to tread, Or hand, to toil, aspir'd to be the head? What if the head, the eye, or ear repin'd To serve mere engines to the ruling mind? Just as absurd for any part to claim To be another, in this gen'ral frame; Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains The great directing mind of all ordains.</p>

<p>All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body nature is, and God the soul; That, chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same, Great in the earth, as in th' aethereal frame, Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees, Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent, Spreads undivided, operates unspent; Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part, As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart; As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns, As the rapt seraph that adores and burns: To him no high, no low, no great, no small; He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.</p>

<p>Cease then, nor order imperfection name: Our proper bliss depends on what we blame. Know thy own point: this kind, this due degree Of blindness, weakness, Heav'n bestows on thee. Submit.  In this, or any other sphere, Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear: Safe in the hand of one disposing pow'r,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE 415</p>

<p>Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.</p>

<p>All nature is but art, unknown to thee;</p>

<p>All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;</p>

<p>All discord, harmony not understood;</p>

<p>All partial evil, universal good.</p>

<p>And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,</p>

<p>One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right.</p>

<p>Epistle IIOf the nature and state of man with respect to himself,</p>

<p>as an individual</p>

<p>I.   Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of mankind is man. Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state, A being darkly wise, and rudely great: With too much knowledge for the sceptic side, With too much weakness for the Stoic's pride, He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest; In doubt to deem himself a God, or beast; In doubt his mind or body to prefer; Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err; Alike in ignorance, his reason such, Whether he thinks too little or too much: Chaos of thought and passion, all confus'd; Still by himself abus'd or disabus'd; Created half to rise, and half to fall; Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all; Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd: The glory, jest, and riddle of the world!</p>

<p>Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides, Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, Correct old time, and regulate the sun: Go, soar with Plato to th' empyreal sphere, To the first good, first perfect, and first fair; Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs trod And quitting sense call imitating God; As eastern priests in giddy circles run, And turn their heads to imitate the sun. Go, teach eternal wisdom how to rule Then drop into thyself, and be a fool!</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Superior beings, when of late they saw A mortal man unfold all nature's law, Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly shape, And shew'd a Newton as we shew an ape.</p>

<p>Could he, whose rules the rapid comet bind, Describe or fix one movement of his mind? Who saw its fires here rise, and there descend, Explain his own beginning, or his end? Alas what wonder! man's superior part Uncheck'd may rise, and climb from art to art; But when his own great work is but begun, What reason weaves, by passion is undone.</p>

<p>Trace science then, with modesty thy guide; First strip off all her equipage of pride; Deduct what is but vanity, or dress, Or learning's luxury, or idleness; Or tricks to shew the stretch of human brain, Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain; Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent parts Of all our vices have created arts; Then see how little the remaining sum, Which serv'd the past, and must the times to come!</p>

<p>II.   Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and reason, to restrain; Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call, Each works its end, to move or govern all: And to their proper operation still Ascribe all good, to their improper, ill.</p>

<p>Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul; Reason's comparing balance rules the whole. Man, but for that, no action could attend, And, but for this, were active to no end: Fix'd like a plant on his peculiar spot, To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot: Or, meteor-like, flame lawless thro' the void, Destroying others, by himself destroy'd.</p>

<p>Most strength the moving principle requires; Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires. Sedate and quiet the comparing lies, Form'd but to check, delib'rate, and advise.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Self-love, still stronger, as its object's nigh; Reason's at distance, and in prospect lie: That sees immediate good by present sense; Reason, the future and the consequence. Thicker than arguments, temptations throng, At best more watchful this, but that more strong. The action of the stronger to suspend Reason still use, to reason still attend. Attention habit and experience gains; Each strengthens reason, and self-love restrains.</p>

<p>Let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight, More studious to divide than to unite; And grace and virtue, sense and reason split, With all the rash dexterity of wit. Wits, just like fools, at war about a name, Have full as oft no meaning, or the same. Self-love and reason to one end aspire, Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire; But greedy that, its object would devour, This taste the honey, and not wound the flow'r: Pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood, Our greatest evil, or our greatest good.</p>

<p>III.   Modes of self-love the passions we may call: 'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all: But since not ev'ry good we can divide, And reason bids us for our own provide: Passions, tho' selfish, if their means be fair, List under Reason, and deserve her care; Those, that imparted, court a nobler aim, Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name.</p>

<p>In lazy apathy let stoics boast Their virtue fix'd; 'tis fix'd as in a frost; Contracted all, retiring to the breast; But strength of mind is exercise, not rest: The rising tempest puts in act the soul, Parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole. On life's vast ocean diversely we sail, Reason the card, but passion is the gale; Nor God alone in the still calm we find, He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Passions, like elements, tho' born to fight, Yet, mix'd and soften'd, in his work unite: These 'tis enough to temper and employ; But what composes man, can man destroy? Suffice that reason keep to nature's road, Subject, compound them, follow her and God. Love, hope,.and joy, fair pleasure's smiling train, Hate, fear, and grief, the family of pain, These mixt with art, and to due bounds confin'd, Make and maintain the balance of the mind: The lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife Gives all the strength and colour of our life.</p>

<p>Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes; And, when in act they cease, in prospect rise: Present to grasp, and future still to find, The whole employ of body and of mind. All spread their charms, but charm not all alike; On diff'rent senses diff'rent objects strike; Hence diff'rent passions more or less inflame, As strong or weak, the organs of the frame; And hence one master passion in the breast, Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest.</p>

<p>As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath, Receives the lurking principle of death; The young disease, that must subdue at length, Grows with his growth, and strengthens with strength:</p>

<p>So, cast and mingled with his very frame, The mind's disease, its ruling passion came; Each vital humour which should feed the whole, Soon flows to this, in body and in soul: Whatever warms the heart, or fills the head, As the mind opens, and its functions spread, Imagination plies her dang'rous art, And pours it all upon the peccant part.</p>

<p>Nature its mother, habit is its nurse; Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse; Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r, As heav'n's blest beam turns vinegar more sour.</p>

<p>We, wretched subjects tho' to lawful sway,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>In this weak queen some fav'rite still obey: Ah! if she lend not arms, as well as rules, What can she more than tell us we are fools? Teach us to mourn our nature, not to mend, A sharp accuser, but a helpless friend! Or from a judge turn pleader, to persuade The choice we make, or justify it made; Proud of an easy conquest all along, She but removes weak passions for the strong: So, when small humours gather to a gout, The doctor fancies he has driv'n them out.</p>

<p>Yes, nature's road must ever be preferr'd; Reason is here no guide, but still a guard; 'Tis hers to rectify, not overthrow, And treat this passion more as friend than foe; A mightier pow'r the strong direction sends, And sev'ral men impels to sev'ral ends: Like varying winds by other passions tost, This drives them constant to a certain coast. Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, please, Or (oft more strong than all) the love of ease; Thro' life 'tis followed, ev'n at life's expense; The merchant's toil, the sage's indolence, The monk's humility, the hero's pride, All, all alike, find reason on their side.</p>

<p>Th' eternal art educing good from ill, Grafts on this passion our best principle: 'Tis thus the mercury of man is fix'd, Strong grows the virtue with his nature mix'd; The dross cements what else were too refin'd, And in one int'rest body acts with mind.</p>

<p>As fruits, ungrateful to the planter's care, On savage stocks inserted, learn to bear; The surest virtues thus from passions shoot, Wild nature's vigor working at the root. What crops of wit and honesty appear From spleen, from obstinacy, hate or fear! See anger, zeal and fortitude supply; Ev'n av'rice, prudence; sloth, philosophy; Lust, thro' some certain strainers well refin'd,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Is gentle love, and charms all womankind;</p>

<p>Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave,</p>

<p>Is emulation in the learn'd or brave;</p>

<p>Nor virtue, male or female, can we name,</p>

<p>But what will grow on pride, or grow on shame.</p>

<p>Thus nature gives us (let it check our pride) The virtue nearest to our vice ally'd: Reason the byas turns to good from ill, And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will, The fiery soul abhorr'd in Catiline, In Decius charms, in Curtius is divine: The same ambition can destroy or save, And makes a patriot as it makes a knave.</p>

<p>This light and darkness in our chaos join'd, What shall divide?   The God within the mind.</p>

<p>Extremes in nature equal ends produce, In man they join to some mysterious use; Tho' each by turns the other's bound invade, As, in some well-wrought picture, light and shade, And oft so mix, the diff'rence is too nice Where ends the virtue or begins the vice.</p>

<p>Fools! who from hence into the notion fall, That vice or virtue there is none at all. If white and black blend, soften, and unite A thousand ways, is there no black or white? Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain; 'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain.</p>

<p>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace. But where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed: Ask where's the north ? at York, 'tis on the Tweed; In Scodand, at the Orcades; and there, At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where. No creature owns it in the first degree, But thinks his neighbour farther gone than he: Ev'n those who dwell beneath its very zone, Or never feel the rage, or never own; What happier natures shrink at with affright,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>The hard inhabitant contends is right.</p>

<p>Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be, Few in th' extreme, but all in the degree; The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise; And ev'n the best, by fits, what they despise. 'Tis but by parts we follow good or ill; For, vice or virtue, self directs it still; Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal; But heav'n's great view is one, and that the whole, That counter-works each folly and caprice; That disappoints th' effect of ev'ry vice; That, happy frailties to all ranks apply'd, Shame to the virgin, to the matron pride, Fear to the statesman, rashness to the chief, To kings presumption, and to crowds belief: That, virtue's ends from vanity can raise, Which seeks no int'rest, no reward but praise; And byild on wants, and on defects of mind, The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind.</p>

<p>Heav'n forming each on other to depend, A master, or a servant, or a friend, Bids each on other for assistance call, 'Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all. Wants, frailties, passions, closer still ally The common int'rest, or endear the tie. To these we owe true friendship, love sincere, Each home-felt joy that life inherits here; Yet from the same we learn, in its decline, Those joys, those loves, those int'rests to resign; Taught half by reason, half by mere decay, To welcome death, and calmly pass away.</p>

<p>Whate'er the passionknowledge, fame, or pelf, Not one will change his neighbour with himself. The learn'd is happy nature to explore, The fool is happy that he knows no more; The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n, The poor contents him with the care of heav'n. See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing, The sot a hero, lunatic a king; The starving chemist in his golden views</p>

<p>422 ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Supremely blest, the poet in his muse.</p>

<p>See some strange comfort ev'ry state attend, And pride bestow'd on all, a common friend; See some fit passion ev'ry age supply, Hope travels thro', nor quits us when we die.</p>

<p>Behold the child, by nature's kindly law, Pleas'd with a rattle, tickled with a straw: Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight, A litde louder, but as empty quite: Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage, And beads and pray'r-books are the toys of age: Pleas'd with this bauble still, as that before; 'Till tir'd he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er.</p>

<p>Meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays Those painted clouds that beautify our days; Each want of happiness by hope supply'd, And each vacuity of sense by pride: These build as fast as knowledge can destroy; In folly's cup still laughs the bubble, joy; One prospect lost, another still we gain; And not a vanity is giv'n in vain; Ev'n mean self-love becomes, by force divine, The scale to measure others' wants by thine. See! and confess one comfort still must rise; 'Tis this, Tho' man's a fool, yet God is wise.</p>

<p>Epistle IIIOf the nature and state of man with respect to society</p>

<p>Here then we rest; 'The universal cause Acts to one end, but acts by various laws.' In all the madness of superfluous health, The trim of pride, the impudence of wealth, Let this great truth be present night and day; But most be present, if we preach or pray.</p>

<p>Look round our world; behold the chain of love Combining all below and all above. See plasdc nature working to this end, The single atoms each to other tend, Attract, attracted to, the next in place Form'd and impell'd its neighbour to embrace. See matter next, with various life endu'd,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Press to one centre still, the gen'ral good.</p>

<p>See dying vegetables life sustain,</p>

<p>See life dissolving vegetate again:</p>

<p>All forms that perish other forms supply,</p>

<p>(By turns we catch the vital breath, and die),</p>

<p>Like bubbles on the sea of matter born,</p>

<p>They rise, they break, and to that sea return.</p>

<p>Nothing is foreign; parts relate to whole;</p>

<p>One all-extending, all-preserving soul</p>

<p>Connects each being, greatest with the least;</p>

<p>Made beast in aid of man, and man of beast;</p>

<p>All serv'd, all serving: nothing stands alone;</p>

<p>The chain holds on, and where it ends, unknown.</p>

<p>Has God, thou fool! work'd solely for thy good, Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food? Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn, For him as kindly spread the flow'ry lawn: Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings? Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings. Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat? Loves of his own and raptures swell the note. The bounding steed you pompously bestride, Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride. Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain? The birds of heav'n shall vindicate their grain. Thine the full harvest of the golden year? Part pays, and jusdy, the deserving steer: The hog, that plows not, nor obeys thy call, Lives on the labours of this lord of all.</p>

<p>Know, nature's children all divide her care; The fur that warms a monarch, warm'd a bear. While man exclaims, 'See all things for my use!' 'See man for mine!' replies a pamper'd goose: And just as short of reason he must fall, Who thinks all made for one, not one for all.</p>

<p>Grant that the pow'rful still the weak control; Be man the wit and tyrant of the whole: Nature that tyrant checks; he only knows, And helps, another creature's wants and woes. Say, will the falcon, stooping from above,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Smit with her varying plumage, spare the dove? Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings? Or hears the hawk when Philomela sings? Man cares for all: to birds he gives his woods, To beasts his pastures, and to fish his floods; For some his int'rest prompts him to provide, For more his pleasure, yet for more his pride: All feed on one vain patron, and enjoy Th' extensive blessing of his luxury, That very life his learned hunger craves, He saves from famine, from the savage saves; Nay, feasts the animal he dooms his feast, And, till he ends the being, makes it blest: Which sees no more the stroke, or feels the pain, Than favour'd man by touch ether'al slain. The creature had his feast of life before; Thou too must perish, when thy feast is o'er!</p>

<p>To each unthinking being, heav'n, a friend, Gives not the useless knowledge of its end: To man imparts it; but with such a view As, while he dreads it, makes him hope it too: The hour conceal'd, and so remote the fear, Death still draws nearer, never seeming near. Great standing miracle! that heav'n assign'd Its only thinking thing this turn of mind.</p>

<p>II.   Whether with reason, or with instinct blest, Know, all enjoy that pow'r which suits them best; To bliss alike by that direction tend, And find the means proportion'd to their end. Say, where full instinct is th' unerring guide, What Pope or council can they need beside? Reason, however able, cool at best, Cares not for service, or but serves when prest, Stays 'till we call, and then not often near; But honest instinct comes a volunteer, Sure never to o'er-shoot, but just to hit; While sdll too wide or short is human wit; Sure by quick nature happiness to gain, Which heavier reason labours at in vain. This too serves always, reason never long;</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>One must go right, the other may go wrong. See then the acting and comparing pow'rs One in their nature, which are two in ours; And reason raise o'er instinct as you can, In this 'tis God directs, in that 'tis man.</p>

<p>Who taught the nations of the field and flood To shun their poison, and to chuse their food? Prescient, the tides or tempests to withstand, Build on the wave, or arch beneath the sand? Who made the spider parallels design, Sure as De Moivre, without rule or line? Who bid the stork, Columbus-like, explore Heav'ns not his own, and worlds unknown before? Who calls the council, states the certain day, Who forms the phalanx, and who points the way?</p>

<p>III.   God, in the nature of each being, founds Its proper bliss, and sets its proper bounds: But as he fram'd a whole, the whole to bless, On mutual wants built mutual happiness: So from the first, eternal order ran, And creature link'd to creature, man to man. Whate'er of life all-quick'ning ether keeps, Or breathes thro' air, or shoots beneath the deeps, Or pours profuse on earth, one nature feeds The vital flame, and swells the genial seeds. Not man alone, but all that roam the wood, Or wing the sky, or roll along the flood, Each loves itself, but not itself alone, Each sex desires alike, 'till two are one. Nor ends the pleasure with the fierce embrace; They love themselves, a third time, in their race. Thus beast and bird their common charge attend The mothers nurse it, and the sires defend; The young dismiss'd to wander earth or air, There stops the instinct, and there ends the care; The link dissolves, each seeks a fresh embrace, Another love succeeds, another race. A longer care man's helpless kind demands; That longer care contracts more lasting bands: Reflection, reason, still the ties improve,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>At once extend the int'rest, and the love: With choice we fix, with sympathy we burn; Each virtue in each passion takes its turn; And sdll new needs, new helps, new habits rise, That graft benevolence on charities. Still as one brood, and as another rose, These nat'ral love maintain'd, habitual those: The last, scarce ripen'd into perfect man, Saw helpless him from whom their life began: Mem'ry and fore-cast just returns engage, That pointed back to youth, this on to age; While pleasure, gratitude, and hope, combin'd, Still spread the int'rest and preserv'd the kind.</p>

<p>IV.   Nor think, in nature's state they blindly trod; The state of nature was the reign of God: Self-love and social at her birth began, Union the bond of all things, and of man. Pride then was not; nor arts, that pride to aid; Man walk'd with beast, joint tenant of the shade, The same his table, and the same his bed; No murder cloth'd him, and no murder fed. In the same temple, the resounding wood, All vocal beings hymn'd their equal God: The shrine with gore unstain'd, with gold undrest, Unbrib'd, unbloody, stood the blameless priest: Heav'n's attribute was universal care, And man's prerogative, to rule, but spare. Ah! how unlike the man of times to come! Of half that live the butcher and the tomb; Who, foe to nature, hears the gen'ral groan, Murders their species, and betrays his own. But just disease to luxury succeeds, And ev'ry death its own avenger breeds; The fury-passions from that blood began, And turn'd on man, a fiercer savage, man.</p>

<p>See him from nature rising slow to art! To copy instinct then was reason's part; Thus then to man the voice of nature spake, 'Go, from the creatures thy instructions take: Learn from the birds what food the thickets yield;</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE 427</p>

<p>Learn from the beasts the physic of the field; Thy arts of building from the bee receive; Learn of the mole to plow, the worm to weave; Learn of the litde nautilus to sail, Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale. Here too all forms of social union find, And hence let reason, late, instruct mankind: Here subterranean works and cities see; There towns aerial on the waving tree. Learn each small people's genius, policies, The ant's republic, and the realm of bees; How those in common all their wealth bestow, And anarchy without confusion know; And these forever, tho' a monarch reign, Their separate cells and properties maintain. Mark what unvary'd laws preserve each state, Laws wise as nature, and as fix'd as fate. In vain thy reason finer webs shall draw, Entangle justice in her net of law, And right, too rigid, harden into wrong; Still for the strong too weak, the weak too strong. Yet go! and thus o'er all the creatures sway, Thus let the wiser make the rest obey; And for those arts mere instinct could afford, Be crown'd as monarchs, or as gods ador'd.'</p>

<p>V.   Great nature spoke; observant man obey'd; Cities were built, societies were made: Here rose one litde state; another near Grew by like means, and join'd, thro' love or fear. Did here the trees with ruddier burdens bend, And there the streams in purer rills descend? What war could ravish, commerce could bestow, And he return'd a friend, who came a foe. Converse and love mankind might strongly draw, When love was liberty, and nature law. Thus states were form'd; the name of king unknown, 'Till common int'rest plac'd the sway in one. 'Twas virtue only (or in arts or arms, Diffusing blessings, or averting harms) The same which in a sire the sons obey'd,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>A prince the father of a people made.</p>

<p>VI.   '      then, by nature crown'd, each patriarch sate, King, priest and parent of his growing state; On him, their second providence, they hung, Their law his eye, their oracle his tongue. He from the wand'ring furrow call'd the food, Taught to command the fire, control the flood, Draw forth the monsters of th' abyss profound, Or fetch th' aerial eagle to the ground, 'Till drooping, sick'ning, dying, they began Whom they rever'd as God to mourn as man: Then, looking up from sire to sire, explor'd One great first father, and that first ador'd. Or plain tradition that this All begun, Convey'd unbroken faith from sire to son; The worker from the work distinct was known, And simple reason never sought but one: Ere wit oblique had broke that steady light, Man, like his maker, saw that all was right; To virtue, in the paths of pleasure trod, And own'd a father when he own'd a God. Love all the faith, and all th' allegiance then; For nature knew no right divine in men, No ill could fear in God; and understood A sov'reign being, but a sov'reign good. True faith, true policy, united ran, That was but love of God, and this of man.</p>

<p>Who first taught souls enslav'd, and realms undone, Th' enormous faith of many made for one; That proud exception to all nature's laws, T' invert the world, and counter-work its cause? Force first made conquest, and that conquest, law; 'Till superstition taught the tyrant awe, Then shar'd the tyranny, then lent it aid, And gods of conqu'rors, slaves of subjects made: She, 'midst the lightning's blaze, and thunder's sound, When rock'd the mountains, and when groan'd the ground,</p>

<p>She taught the weak to bend, the proud to pray, To pow'r unseen, and mightier far than they:</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>She, from the rending earth, and bursting skies, Saw gods descend, and fiends i '  ial rise: Here fix'd the dreadful, there tlu ,iest abodes; Fear made her devils, and weak hope her gods; Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust, Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust; Such as the souls of cowards might conceive, And, form'd like tyrants, tyrants would believe. Zeal then, not charity, became the guide; And hell was built on spite, and heav'n on pride. Then sacred seem'd th' ether'al vault no more; Altars grew marble then, and reek'd with gore: Then first the flamen tasted living food; Next his grim idol smear'd with human blood; With heav'n's own thunders shook the world below, And play'd the god an engine on his foe.</p>

<p>So drives self-love, thro' just, and thro' unjust, To one man's pow'r, ambition, lucre, lust. The same self-lqve, in all, becomes the cause Of what restrains him, government and laws. For, what one likes, if others like as well, What serves one will, when many wills rebel? How shall he keep, what, sleeping or awake, A weaker may surprise, a stronger take? His safety must his liberty restrain: All join to guard what each desires to gain. Forc'd into virtue thus, by self-defence, Ev'n kings learn'd justice and benevolence: Self-love forsook the path it first pursu'd, And found the private in the public good.</p>

<p>'Twas then the studious head or gen'rous mind, Follow'r of God, or friend of human-kind, Poet or patriot, rose but to restore The faith and moral nature gave before; Relum'd her ancient light, not kindled new, If not God's image, yet his shadow drew: Taught pow'r's due use to people and to kings, Taught nor to slack, nor strain its tender strings, The less, or greater, set so justly true, That touching one must strike the other too;</p>

<p>430 ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>'Till jarring int'rests, of themselves create</p>

<p>Th' according music of a well-mix'd state.</p>

<p>Such is the world's great harmony, that springs</p>

<p>From order, union, full consent of things:</p>

<p>Where small and great, where weak and mighty, made</p>

<p>To serve, not suffer, strengthen, not invade;</p>

<p>More pow'rful each as needful to the rest,</p>

<p>And in proportion as it blesses, blest;</p>

<p>Draw to one point, and to one centre bring</p>

<p>Beast, man, or angel, servant, lord, or king.</p>

<p>For forms of government let fools contest; Whate'er is best administer'd is best: For modes of faith, let graceless zealots fight; His can't be wrong whose life is in the right: In faith and hope the world will disagree, But all mankind's concern is Charity: All must be false that thwart this one great end; And all of God, that bless mankind, or mend.</p>

<p>Man, like the gen'rous vine, supported lives; The strength he gains is from th' embrace he gives. On their own axis as the planets run, Yet make at once their circle round the sun; So two consistent motions act the soul; And one regards itself, and one the whole. Thus God and nature link'd the gen'ral frame, And bade self-love and social be the same.</p>

<p>Epistle IVOf the nature and state of man with respect to</p>

<p>happiness</p>

<p>Oh Happiness! our being's end and aim!</p>

<p>Good, pleasure, ease, content! whate'er thy name:</p>

<p>That something still which prompts th' eternal sigh,</p>

<p>For which we bear to live, or dare to die,</p>

<p>Which sdll so near us, yet beyond us lies,</p>

<p>O'er-look'd, seen double, by the fool, and wise.</p>

<p>Plant of celestial seed! if dropt below,</p>

<p>Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?</p>

<p>Fair op'ning to some court's propitious shine,</p>

<p>Or deep with di'monds in the flaming mine?</p>

<p>Twin'd with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Or reap'd in iron harvests of the field? Where grows?where grows it not? If vain our toil,</p>

<p>We ought to blame the culture, not the soil:</p>

<p>Fix'd to no spot is happiness sincere,</p>

<p>'Tis nowhere to be found, or ev'rywhere:</p>

<p>'Tis never to be bought, but always free,</p>

<p>And fled from monarchs, St. John! dwells with thee.</p>

<p>Ask of the learn'd the way? The learn'd are blind; This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind; Some place the bliss in action, some in ease, Those call it pleasure, and contentment these; Some sunk to beasts, find pleasure end in pain; Some swell'd to gods, confess e'en virtue vain; Or indolent, to each extreme they fall, To trust in ev'ry thing, or doubt of all.</p>

<p>Who thus define it, say they more or less Than this, that happiness is happiness?</p>

<p>Take nature's path, and mad opinion's leave; All states can reach it, and all heads conceive; Obvious her goods, in no extreme they dwell; There needs but thinking right, and meaning well; And mourn our various portions as we please, Equal is common sense, and common ease.</p>

<p>Remember, man, 'The universal cause Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws'; And makes what happiness we justly call Subsist not in the good of one, but all. There's not a blessing individuals find, But some way leans and hearkens to the kind: No bandit fierce, no tyrant mad with pride, No cavern'd hermit, rests self-satisfy'd: Who most to shun or hate mankind pretend, Seek an admirer, or who would fix a friend: Abstract what others feel, what others think, All pleasures sicken, and all glories sink: Each has his share; and who would more obtain, Shall find the pleasure pays not half the pain.</p>

<p>Order is heav'n's first law; and this confest, Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>More rich, more wise; but who infers from hence</p>

<p>That such are happier, shocks all common sense.</p>

<p>Heav'n to mankind impartial we confess,</p>

<p>If all are equal in their happiness:</p>

<p>But mutual wants this happiness increase;</p>

<p>All nature's diff'rence keeps all nature's peace.</p>

<p>Condition, circumstance is not the thing;</p>

<p>Bliss is the same in subject or in king,</p>

<p>In who obtain defence, or who defend,</p>

<p>In him who is, or him who finds a friend:</p>

<p>Heav'n breathes thro' ev'ry member of the whole</p>

<p>One common blessing, as one common soul.</p>

<p>But fortune's gifts if each alike possest,</p>

<p>And each were equal, must not all contest?</p>

<p>If then to all men happiness was meant,</p>

<p>God in externals could not place content.</p>

<p>Fortune her gifts may variously dispose, And these be happy call'd, unhappy those; But heav'n's just balance equal will appear, While those are plac'd in hope, and these in fear: Not present good or ill, the joy or curse, But future views of better, or of worse. Oh sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise, By mountains pil'd on mountains, to the skies? Heav'n still with laughter the vain toil surveys, And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.</p>

<p>Know, all the good that individuals find, Or God and nature meant to mere mankind, Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of sense, Lie in three words, health, peace, and competence But health consists with temperance alone; And peace, oh virtue! peace is all thy own. The good or bad the gifts of fortune gain; But these less taste them, as they worse obtain. Say, in pursuit of profit or delight, Who risk the most, that take wrong means, or right? Of vice or virtue, whether blest or curst, Which meets contempt, or which compassion first? Count all th' advantage prosp'rous vice attains, 'Tis but what virtue flies from and disdains:</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>And grant the bad what happiness they would, One they must want, which is, to pass for good.</p>

<p>Oh blind to truth, and God's whole scheme below, Who fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe! Who sees and follows that great scheme the best, Best knows the blessing, and will most be blest. But fools the good alone unhappy call, For ills or accidents that chance to all. See Falkland dies, the virtuous and the just! See god-like Turenne prostrate on the dust! See Sidney bleeds amid the martial strife! Was this their virtue, or contempt of life? Say, was it virtue, more tho' heav'n ne'er gave, Lamented Digby! sunk thee to the grave? Tell me, if virtue made the son expire, Why, full of days and honour, lives the sire ? Why drew Marseilles' good bishop purer breath, When nature sicken'd and each gale was death! Or why so long (in life if long can be) Lent heav'n a parent to the poor and me?</p>

<p>What makes all physical or moral ill ? There deviates nature, and here wanders will. God sends not ill; if rightly understood, Or partial ill is universal good, Or change admits, or nature lets it fall, Short, and but rare, 'till man improv'd it all. We just as wisely might of heav'n complain That righteous Abel was destroy'd by Cain, As that the virtuous son is ill at ease, When his lewd father gave the dire disease. Think we, like some weak prince, th' eternal cause Prone for his fav'rites to reverse his laws?</p>

<p>Shall burning /Etna, if a sage requires, Forget to thunder, and recall her fires ? On air or sea new motions be imprest, Oh blameless Bethel! to relieve thy breast? When the loose mountain trembles from on high Shall gravitation cease, if you go by? Or some old temple, nodding to its fall, For Chartres' head reserve the hanging wall ?</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>But still this world (so fitted for the knave) Contents us not. A better shall we have? A kingdom of the just then let it be: But first consider how those just agree. The good must merit God's peculiar care; But who, but God, can tell us who they are ? One thinks on Calvin heav'n's own spirit fell; Another deems him instrument of hell; If Calvin feel heav'n's blessing, or its rod, This cries there is, and that, there is no God. What shocks one part will edify the rest, Nor with one system can they all be blest. The very best will variously incline, And what rewards your virtue, punish mine. Whatever is, is right.This world, 'tis true, Was made for Caesarbut for Titus too; And which more blest, who chain'd his country, say, Or he whose virtue sigh'd to lose a day ?</p>

<p>'But sometimes virtue starves, while vice is fed.' What then? is the reward of virtue bread? That vice may merit, 'tis the price of toil; The knave deserves it, when he tills the soil, The knave deserves it, when he tempts the main, Where folly fights for kings, or dives for gain. The good man may be weak, be indolent; Nor is his claim to plenty, but content. But grant him riches, your demand is o'er? 'No, shall the good want health, the good want pow'r Add health and pow'r, and ev'ry earthly thing, 'Why bounded pow'r? why private? why no king? Nay, why external for internal giv'n? Why is not man a God, and earth a heav'n?' Who ask and reason thus, will scarce conceive God gives enough, while he has more to give: Immense the pow'r, immense were the demand; Say, at what part of nature will they stand?</p>

<p>What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy, The soul's calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy, Is virtue's prize: a better would you fix? Then give humility a coach and six,</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Justice a conq'ror's sword, or truth a gown,</p>

<p>Or public spirit its great cure, a crown.</p>

<p>Weak, foolish man! will heav'n reward us there</p>

<p>With the same trash mad mortals wish for here?</p>

<p>The boy and man an individual makes,</p>

<p>Yet sigh'st thou now for apples and for cakes?</p>

<p>Go, like the Indian, in another life</p>

<p>Expect thy dog, thy bottle, and thy wife,</p>

<p>As well as dream such trifles are assign'd,</p>

<p>As toys and empires, for a god-like mind.</p>

<p>Rewards, that either would to virtue bring</p>

<p>No joy, or be destructive of the thing:</p>

<p>How oft by these at sixty are undone</p>

<p>The virtues of a saint at twenty-one!</p>

<p>To whom can riches give repute, or trust, Content, or pleasure, but the good and just? Judges and senates have been bought for gold, Esteem and love were never to be sold. Oh fool! to think God hates the worthy mind, The lover and the love of human-kind, Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear, Because he wants a thousand pounds a year.</p>

<p>Honour and shame from no condition rise; Act well your part, there all the honour lies. Fortune in men has some small diff'rence mad' One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade; The cobler apron'd, and the parson gown'd, The frier hooded, and the monarch crown'd. 'What differ more (you cry) than crown and cowl?' I'll tell you, friend! a wise man and a fool. You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk, Or, cobler-like, the parson will be drunk, Worth makes the man, and want of it, the fellow; The rest is all but leather or prunella.</p>

<p>Stuck o'er with titles and hung round with strings, That thou may'st be by kings, or whores of kings. Boast the pure blood of an illustrious race, In quiet flow from Lucrece to Lucrece: But by your fathers' worth if your's you rate, Count me those only who were good and great.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Go! if your ancient, but ignoble blood</p>

<p>Has crept thro' scoundrels ever since the flood,</p>

<p>Go! and pretend your family is young;</p>

<p>Nor own your fathers have been fools so long.</p>

<p>What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards?</p>

<p>Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards,</p>

<p>Look next on greatness; say where greatness lies. 'Where, but among the heroes and the wise?' Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed, From Macedonia's madman to the Swede; The whole strange purpose of their lives, to find Or make, an enemy of all mankind! Not one looks backward, onward still he goes, Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose. No less alike the politic and wise; All sly slow things, with circumspective eyes: Men in their loose unguarded hours they take, Not that themselves are wise, but others weak. But grant that those can conquer, these can cheat; 'Tis phrase absurd to call a villain great: Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave, Is but the more a fool, the more a knave. Who noble ends by noble means obtains, Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains, Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed Like Socrates, that man is great indeed.</p>

<p>What's fame ? a fancy'd life in others' breath, A thing beyond us, ev'n before our death. Just what you hear, you have, and what's unknown The same (my lord) if Tully's, or your own. All that we feel of it begins and ends In the small circle of our foes or friends; To all beside as much an empty shade An Eugene living, as a Caesar dead; Alike or when, or where they shone, or shine, Or on the Rubicon, or on the Rhine. A wit's a feather, and a chief a rod; An honest man's the noblest work of God. Fame but from death a villain's name can save, As justice tears his body from the grave;</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>When what t' oblivion better were resign'd, Is hung on high, to poison half mankind. All fame is foreign, but of true desert; Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart: One self approving hour whole years out-weighs Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas; And more true joy Marcellus exil'd feels, Than Caesar with a senate at his heels.</p>

<p>In parts superior what advantage lies? Tell (for you can) what is it to be wise? 'Tis but to know how little can be known; To see all others' faults, and feel your own: Condemn'd in bus'ness or in arts to drudge, Without a second, or without a judge: Truths would you teach, or save a sinking land? All fear, none aid you, and few understand. Painful preeminence! yourself to view Above life's weakness, and its comforts too.</p>

<p>Bring then these blessings to a strict account; Make fair deductions; see to what they 'mount: How much of other each is sure to cost; How each for other oft is wholly lost; How inconsistent greater goods with these; How sometimes life is risqu'd, and always ease: Think, and if still the things thy envy call, Say, would'st thou be the man to whom they fall ? To sigh for ribbands if thou art so silly, Mark how they grace Lord Umbra, or Sir Billy. Is yellow dirt the passion of thy life; Look but on Gripus, or on Gripus' wife. If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shin'd, The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind: Or ravish'd with the whisding of a name, See Cromwell, damn'd to everlasting fame! If all, united, thy ambition call, From ancient story learn to scorn them all. There, in the rich, the honour'd, fam'd and great, See the false scale of happiness complete! In hearts of kings, or arms of queens who lay, How happy those to ruin, these betray.</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Mark by what wretched steps their glory grows, From dirt and sea-weed as proud Venice rose; In each how guilt and greatness equal ran, And all that rais'd the hero, sunk the man: Now Europe's laurels on their brows behold, But stain'd with blood, or ill-exchang'd for gold: Then see them broke with toils, or sunk in ease, Or infamous for plunder'd provinces. Oh, wealth ill-fated! which no act of fame E'er taught to shine, or sanctify'd from shame! What greater bliss attends their close of life? Some greedy minion, or imperious wife, The trophy'd arches, story'd halls invade, And haunt their slumbers in the pompous shade. Alas! not dazzled with their noon-tide ray, Compute the morn and ev'ning to the day; The whole amount of that enormous fame, A tale, that blends their glory with their shame!</p>

<p>Know then this truth, enough for man to know. 'Virtue alone is happiness below.' The only point where human bliss stands still, And tastes the good without the fall to ill; Where only merit constant pay receives, Is blest in what it takes, and what it gives; The joy unequal'd, if its end it gain, And if it lose, attended with no pain: Without satiety, tho' e'er so bless'd, And but more relish'd as the more distress'd: The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears, Less pleasing far than virtue's very tears; Good, from each object, from each place acquir'd, For ever exercis'd, yet never tir'd; Never elated, while one man's oppress'd; Never dejected, while another's bless'd; And where no wants, no wishes can remain, Since but to wish more virtue, is to gain.</p>

<p>See the sole bliss heav'n could on all bestow! Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know: Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind, The bad must miss, the good, untaught, will find;</p>

<p>ALEXANDER POPE</p>

<p>Slave to no sect, who takes no private road, But looks through nature up to nature's God: Pursues that chain which links th' immense design, Joins heav'n and earth, and mortal and divine; Sees, that no being any bliss can know, But touches some above, and some below; Learns, from this union of the rising whole, The first, last purpose of the human soul; And knows where faith, law, morals, all began, All end, in love of God, and love of man.</p>

<p>For him alone, hope leads from goal to goal, And opens still, and opens on his soul; 'Till lengthen'd on to faith, and unconfin'd, It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind. He sees, why nature plants in man alone Hope of known bliss, and faith in bliss unknown: (Nature, whose dictates to no other kind Are giv'n in vain, but what they seek they find) Wise is her present; she connects in this His greatest virtue with his greatest bliss; At once his own bright prospect to be blest, And strongest motive to assist the rest.</p>

<p>Self-love thus push'd to social, to divine, Gives thee to make thy neighbour's blessing thine. Is this too little for the boundless heart? Extend it, let thy enemies have part: Grasp the whole worlds of reason, life, and sense, In one close system of benevolence: Happier as kinder, in whate'er degree, And height of bliss but height of charity.</p>

<p>God loves from whole to parts: but human soul Must rise from individual to the whole. Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake; The centre mov'd, a circle strait succeeds, Another still, and still another spreads; Friend, parent, neighbour, first it will embrace; His country next; and next all human race; Wide and more wide, th' o'erflowings of the mind Take ev'ry creature in, of ev'ry kind;</p>

<p>AMBROSE PHILIPS</p>

<p>Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty blest, And heav'n beholds its image in his breast.</p>

<p>Come then, my friend, my genius, come along; Oh master of the poet, and the song! And while the muse now stoops, or now ascends, To man's low passions, or their glorious ends, Teach me, like thee, in various nature wise, To fall with dignity, with temper rise; Form'd by thy converse, happily to steer From grave to gay, from lively to severe; Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease, Intent to reason, or polite to please. Oh! while along the stream of time thy name Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame; Say, shall my little bark attendant sail, Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale? When statesmen, heroes, kings, in dust repose, Whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes, Shall then this verse to future age pretend Thou wert my guide, philosopher, and friend? That, urg'd by thee, I turn'd the tuneful art From sounds to things, from fancy to the heart; For wit's false mirror held up nature's light; Shew'd erring pride, whatever is, is right; That reason, passion, answer one great aim; That true self-love and social are the same; That virtue only makes our bliss below; And all our knowledge is, ourselves to know.</p>

<p>AMBROSE PHILIPS</p>

<p>[i675(?)-i749]</p>

<p>To Charlotte Pulteney</p>

<p>Timely blossom, Infant fair, Fondling of a happy pair, Every morn and every night Their solicitous delight, Sleeping, waking, still at ease, Pleasing, without skill to please;</p>

<p>COLLEY CIBBER</p>

<p>Little gossip, blithe and hale, Tatding many a broken tale, Singing many a tuneless song, Lavish of a heedless tongue; Simple maiden, void of art, Babbling out the very heart, Yet abandon'd to thy will, Yet imagining no ill, Yet too innocent to blush; Like the linnet in the bush To the mother-linnet's note Moduling her slender throat; Chirping forth thy pretty joys, Wanton in the change of toys, Like the linnet green, in May Flitting to each bloomy spray; Wearied then and glad of rest, Like the linnet in the nest: This thy present happy lot This, in time will be forgot: Other pleasures, other cares, Ever-busy Time prepares; And thou shalt in thy daughter see, This picture, once, resembled thee.</p>

<p>COLLEY CIBBER [7677-/757]</p>

<p>The Blind Boy</p>

<p>0 say what is that thing call'd Light, Which I must ne'er enjoy;</p>

<p>What are the blessings of the sight, O tell your poor blind boy!</p>

<p>You talk of wondrous things you see, You say the sun shines bright;</p>

<p>1 feel him warm, but how can he Or make it day or night?</p>

<p>JAMES THOMSON</p>

<p>My day or night myself I make</p>

<p>Whene'er I sleep or play; And could I ever keep awake</p>

<p>With me 'twere always day.</p>

<p>With heavy sighs I often hear You mourn my hapless woe;</p>

<p>But sure with patience I can bear A loss I ne'er can know.</p>

<p>Then let not what I cannot have</p>

<p>My cheer of mind destroy: Whilst thus I sing, I am a king,</p>

<p>Although a poor blind boy.</p>

<p>JAMES THOMSON [1700-1748]</p>

<p>Rule, Britannia</p>

<p>When Britain first at Heaven's command</p>

<p>Arose from out the azure main, This was the charter of her land, And guardian angels sung the strain: Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the wavesl Britons never shall be slaves.</p>

<p>The nations not so blest as thee Must in their turn to tyrants fall,</p>

<p>Whilst thou shalt flourish great and free The dread and envy of them all.</p>

<p>Still more majesdc shalt thou rise, More dreadful from each foreign stroke:</p>

<p>As the loud blast that tears the skies Serves but to root thy native oak.</p>

<p>Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;</p>

<p>All their attempts to bend thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame,</p>

<p>And work their woe and thy renown.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>To thee belongs the rural reign;</p>

<p>Thy cities shall with commerce shine; All thine shall be the subject main,</p>

<p>And every shore it circles thine!</p>

<p>The Muses, still with Freedom found,</p>

<p>Shall to thy happy coast repair; Blest Isle, with matchless beauty crown'd And manly hearts to guard the fair: Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves! Britons never shall be slaves!</p>

<p>To Fortune</p>

<p>For ever, Fortune, wilt thou prove An unrelenting foe to Love, And when we meet a mutual heart Come in between, and bid us part?</p>

<p>Bid us sigh on from day to day, And wish and wish the soul away; Till youth and genial years are flown, And all the life of life is gone?</p>

<p>But busy, busy, still art thou, To bind the loveless, joyless vow, The heart from pleasure to delude, To join the gentle to the rude.</p>

<p>For once, O Fortune, hear my prayer, And I absolve thy future care; All other blessings I resign, Make but the dear Amanda mine.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY [77/6-/77/]</p>

<p>Elegy</p>

<p>(Written in a Country Churchyard)</p>

<p>The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</p>

<p>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</p>

<p>Save where the beede wheels his droning flight, And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:</p>

<p>Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower The moping owl does to the moon complain</p>

<p>Of such as, wandering near her secret bower, Molest her ancient solitary reign.</p>

<p>Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,</p>

<p>Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</p>

<p>The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,</p>

<p>The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,</p>

<p>The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</p>

<p>For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn Or busy housewife ply her evening care:</p>

<p>No children run to lisp their sire's return, Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</p>

<p>Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,</p>

<p>Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;</p>

<p>How jocund did they drive their team afield! How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</p>

<p>Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;</p>

<p>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile The short and simple annals of the Poor.</p>

<p>The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave</p>

<p>Awaits alike th' inevitable hour: The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,</p>

<p>Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.</p>

<p>Can storied urn or animated bust Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath,</p>

<p>Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?</p>

<p>Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid</p>

<p>Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;</p>

<p>Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd, Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:</p>

<p>But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page, Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;</p>

<p>Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage, And froze the genial current of the soul.</p>

<p>Full many a gem of purest ray serene</p>

<p>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:</p>

<p>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</p>

<p>Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast The little tyrant of his fields withstood,</p>

<p>Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.</p>

<p>Th' applause of listening senates to command, The threats of pain and ruin to despise,</p>

<p>To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, And read their history in a nation's eyes</p>

<p>Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;</p>

<p>Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne, And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide, To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,</p>

<p>Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.</p>

<p>Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;</p>

<p>Along the cool sequester'd vale of life</p>

<p>They kept the noiseless tenour of their way.</p>

<p>Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect Some frail memorial still erected nigh,</p>

<p>With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd, Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.</p>

<p>Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,</p>

<p>The place of fame and elegy supply: And many a holy text around she strews,</p>

<p>That teach the rustic moralist to die.</p>

<p>For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,</p>

<p>Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?</p>

<p>On some fond breast the parting soul relies, Some pious drops the closing eye requires;</p>

<p>E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries, E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.</p>

<p>For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead, Dost in these lines their ardess tale relate;</p>

<p>If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,</p>

<p>Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate,</p>

<p>Haply some hoary-headed swain may say, 'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn</p>

<p>Brushing with hasty steps the dews away, To meet the sun upon the upland lawn;</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>447</p>

<p>'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</p>

<p>His listless length at noon-tide would he stretch, And pore upon the brook that babbles by.</p>

<p>'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn, Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;</p>

<p>Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn, Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.</p>

<p>'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill, Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;</p>

<p>Another came; nor yet beside the rill, Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;</p>

<p>'The next with dirges due in sad array [borne,</p>

<p>Slow through the church-way path we saw him</p>

<p>Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn:'</p>

<p>The Epitaph</p>

<p>Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown;</p>

<p>Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth And Melancholy marled him for her own.</p>

<p>Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere;</p>

<p>Heaven did a recompense as largely send: He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,</p>

<p>He gain'd from Heaven, 'twas all he wish'd, a friend.</p>

<p>No farther see\ his merits to disclose,</p>

<p>Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,</p>

<p>{There they alike in trembling hope repose,) The bosom of his Father and his God.</p>

<p>Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College</p>

<p>Ye distant spires, ye antique towers,</p>

<p>That crown the watery glade, Where grateful Science still adores</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Her Henry's holy shade; And ye, that from the stately brow Of Windsor's heights th' expanse below Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey, Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among Wanders the hoary Thames along</p>

<p>His silver-winding way:</p>

<p>Ah happy hills! ah pleasing shade!</p>

<p>Ah fields beloved in vain! When once my careless childhood stray'd,</p>

<p>A stranger yet to pain! I feel the gales that from ye blow A momentary bliss bestow, As waving fresh their gladsome wing My weary soul they seem to soothe And, redolent of joy and youth,</p>

<p>To breathe a second spring.</p>

<p>Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen</p>

<p>Full many a sprightly race Disporting on thy margent green</p>

<p>The paths of pleasure trace; Who foremost now delight to cleave With pliant arm, thy glassy wave? The captive linnet which enthral? What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed</p>

<p>Or urge the flying ball ?</p>

<p>While some on earnest business bent</p>

<p>Their murmuring labours ply 'Gainst graver hours, that bring constraint</p>

<p>To sweeten liberty: Some bold adventurers disdain The limits of their little reign And unknown regions dare descry: Still as they run they look behind, They hear a voice in every wind,</p>

<p>And snatch a fearful joy.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Gay Hope is theirs by fancy fed,</p>

<p>Less pleasing when possest; The tear forgot as soon as shed,</p>

<p>The sunshine of the breast: Theirs buxom Health, of rosy hue, Wild Wit, Invention ever new, And lively Cheer, of Vigour born; The thoughdess day, the easy night, The spirits pure, the slumbers light</p>

<p>That fly th' approach of morn.</p>

<p>Alas! regardless of their doom</p>

<p>The little victims play! No sense have they of ills to come</p>

<p>Nor care beyond to-day: Yet see how all around 'em wait The ministers of human fate And black Misfortune's baleful train! Ah shew them where in ambush stand To seize their prey, the murderous band!</p>

<p>Ah, tell them they are men!</p>

<p>These shall the fury Passions tear,</p>

<p>The vultures of the mind, Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,</p>

<p>And shame that sculks behind; Or pining Love shall waste their youth, Or Jealousy with rankling tooth That inly gnaws the secret heart, And Envy wan, and faded Care, Grim-visaged comfortless Despair,</p>

<p>And Sorrow's piercing dart.</p>

<p>Ambition this shall tempt to rise,</p>

<p>Then whirl the wretch from high To bitter Scorn a sacrifice And grinning Infamy. The stings of Falsehood those shall try And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye, That mocks the tear it forced to flow;</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>And keen Remorse with blood defiled, And moody Madness laughing wild Amid severest woe.</p>

<p>Lo, in the Vale of Years beneath</p>

<p>A griesly troop are seen, The painful family of Death,</p>

<p>More hideous than their Queen: This racks the joints, this fires the veins, That every labouring sinew strains, Those in the deeper vitals rage: Lo! Poverty, to fill the band, That numbs the soul with icy hand,</p>

<p>And slow-consuming Age.</p>

<p>To each his sufferings: all are men,</p>

<p>Condemn'd alike to groan; The tender for another's pain,</p>

<p>Th' unfeeling for his own. Yet, ah! why should they know their fate, Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness too swiftly flies? Thought would destroy their paradise! No more;where ignorance is bliss,</p>

<p>'Tis folly to be wise.</p>

<p>Hymn to Adversity</p>

<p>Daughter of Jove, relendess power, Thou tamer of the human breast, Whose iron scourge and torturing hour</p>

<p>The bad affright, afflict the best! Bound in thy adamantine chain The proud are taught to taste of pain, And purple tyrants vainly groan With pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone.</p>

<p>When first thy Sire to send on earth Virtue, his darling child, design'd,</p>

<p>To thee he gave the heavenly birth And bade to form her infant mind.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Stern, rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore With patience many a year she bore; What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know, And from her own she learn'd to melt at others' woe.</p>

<p>Scared at thy frown terrific, fly</p>

<p>Self-pleasing Folly's idle brood, Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy,</p>

<p>And leave us leisure to be good. Light they disperse, and with them go The summer Friend, the flattering Foe; By vain Prosperity received, To her they vow their truth, and are again believed.</p>

<p>Wisdom in sable garb array'd</p>

<p>Immersed in rapturous thought profound, And Melancholy, silent maid,</p>

<p>With leaden eye, that loves the ground, Still on thy solemn steps attend: Warm Charity, the general friend, With Justice, to herself severe, And Pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear.</p>

<p>O! gently on thy suppliant's head</p>

<p>Dread Goddess, lay thy chastening hand!</p>

<p>Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad, Nor circled with the vengeful band</p>

<p>(As by the impious thou art seen)</p>

<p>With thundering voice, and threatening mien,</p>

<p>With screaming Horror's funeral cry, Despair, and fell Disease, and ghastly Poverty;</p>

<p>Thy form benign, O Goddess, wear,</p>

<p>Thy milder influence impart, Thy philosophic train be there.</p>

<p>To soften, not to wound my heart. The generous spark extinct revive, Teach me to love and to forgive Exact my own defects to scan, What others are to feel, and know myself a Man.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Ode on the Spring</p>

<p>Lo! where the rosy-bosom'd Hours,</p>

<p>Fair Venus' train, appear, Disclose the long-expecting flowers</p>

<p>And wake the purple year! The Attic warbler pours her throat Responsive to the cuckoo's note, The untaught harmony of Spring: While, whispering pleasure as they fly, Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky</p>

<p>Their gather'd fragrance fling.</p>

<p>Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch</p>

<p>A broader, browner shade, Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech</p>

<p>O'er-canopies the glade, Beside some water's rushy brink With me the Muse shall sit, and think (At ease reclined in rustic state) How vain the ardour of the Crowd, How low, how little are the Proud,</p>

<p>How indigent the Great!</p>

<p>Still is the toiling hand of Care;</p>

<p>The panting herds repose: Yet hark, how thro' the peopled air</p>

<p>The busy murmur glows! The insect youth are on the wing, Eager to taste the honied spring And float amid the liquid noon: Some lightly o'er the current skim, Some show their gaily-gilded trim</p>

<p>Quick-glancing to the sun.</p>

<p>To Contemplation's sober eye</p>

<p>Such is the race of Man: And they that creep, and they that fly</p>

<p>Shall end where they began. Alike the busy and the gay</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>But flutter thro' life's little day, In Fortune's varying colours drest: Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance, Or chill'd by Age, their airy dance They leave, in dust to rest.</p>

<p>Methinks I hear in accents low</p>

<p>The sportive kind reply: Poor moralist! and what art thou?</p>

<p>A solitary fly! Thy joys no glittering female meets, No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets, No painted plumage to display: On hasty wings thy youth is flown; Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone</p>

<p>We frolic while 'tis May.</p>

<p>The Progress of Poesy A Pindaric Ode</p>

<p>Awake, Aeolian lyre, awake, And give to rapture all thy trembling strings. From Helicon's harmonious springs</p>

<p>A thousand rills their mazy progress take: The laughing flowers that round them blow Drink life and fragrance as they flow. Now the rich stream of Music winds along Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong, Through verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign; Now rolling down the steep amain Headlong, impetuous, see it pour: The rocks and nodding groves re-bellow to the roar</p>

<p>O Sovereign of the willing soul, Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares</p>

<p>And frantic Passions hear thy soft control. On Thracia's hills the Lord of War Has curb'd the fury of his car And dropt his thirsty lance at thy command.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Perching on the sceptred hand</p>

<p>Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king</p>

<p>With ruffled plumes, and flagging wing:</p>

<p>Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie</p>

<p>The terror of his beak, and lightnings of his eye.</p>

<p>Thee the voice, the dance, obey Temper'd to thy warbled lay. O'er Idalia's velvet-green The rosy-crowned Loves are seen On Cytherea's day,</p>

<p>With antic Sport, and blue-eyed Pleasures, Frisking light in frolic measures; Now pursuing, now retreating,</p>

<p>Now in circling troops they meet: To brisk notes in cadence beating</p>

<p>Glance their many-twinkling feet. Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare:</p>

<p>Where'er she turns, the Graces homage pay: With arms sublime that float upon the air</p>

<p>In gliding state she wins her easy way: O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love.</p>

<p>Man's feeble race what ills await! Labour, and Penury, the racks of Pain, Disease, and Sorrow's weeping train,</p>

<p>And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate! The fond complaint, my song, disprove, And justify the laws of Jove. Say, has he given in vain the heavenly Muse Night, and all her sickly dews, Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry He gives to range the dreary sky: Till down the eastern cliffs afar</p>

<p>Hyperion's march they spy, and glittering shafts of war.</p>

<p>In climes beyond the solar road Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam, The Muse has broke the twilight gloom</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>To cheer the shivering native's dull abode. And oft, beneath the odorous shade Of Chili's boundless forests laid, She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat In loose numbers wildly sweet Their feather-cinctured chiefs, and dusky loves. Her track, where'er the Goddess roves, Glory pursue, and generous Shame, Th' unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame.</p>

<p>Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep, Isles, that crown th' Aegean deep, Fields that cool Ilissus laves, Or where Maeander's amber waves In lingering lab'rinths creep, How do your tuneful echoes languish, Mute, but to the voice of anguish! Where each old poetic mountain</p>

<p>Inspiration breathed around; Every shade and hallow'd fountain</p>

<p>Murmur'd deep a solemn sound: Till the sad Nine, in Greece's evil hour</p>

<p>Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains. Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant Power,</p>

<p>And coward Vice, that revels in her chains. When Latium had her lofty spirit lost, They sought, O Albion! next, thy sea-encircled coast.</p>

<p>Far from the sun and summer-gale In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid, What time, where lucid Avon stray'd,</p>

<p>To him the mighty Mother did unveil Her awful face: the dauntless Child Stretch'd forth his little arms, and smiled. This pencil take (she said), whose colours clear Richly paint the vernal year: Thine, too, these golden keys, immortal Boy! This can unlock the gates of Joy; Of Horror that, and thrilling Fears, Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Nor second He, that rode sublime Upon the seraph-wings of Ecstasy The secrets of the Abyss to spy:</p>

<p>He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time: The living Throne, the sapphire-blaze Where Angels tremble while they gaze, He saw; but blasted with excess of light, Closed his eyes in endless night. Behold where Dryden's less presumptuous car Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear Two coursers of ethereal race,</p>

<p>With necks in thunder clothed, and long-resounding pace.</p>

<p>Hark, his hands the lyre explore!</p>

<p>Bright-eyed Fancy, hovering o'er,</p>

<p>Scatters from her pictured urn</p>

<p>Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.</p>

<p>But ah! 'tis heard no more</p>

<p>Oh! Lyre divine, what daring Spirit</p>

<p>Wakes thee now! Tho'he inherit</p>

<p>Nor the pride, nor ample pinion,</p>

<p>That the Theban Eagle bear, Sailing with supreme dominion</p>

<p>Thro' the azure deep of air: Yet oft before his infant eyes would run</p>

<p>Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray With orient hues, unborrow'd of the sun:</p>

<p>Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate: Beneath the Good how farbut far above the Great.</p>

<p>The Bard Pindaric Ode</p>

<p>'Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!</p>

<p>Confusion on thy banners wait! Tho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing</p>

<p>They mock the air with idle state. Helm, nor hauberk's twisted mail Nor e'en thy virtues, tyrant, shall avail</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,</p>

<p>From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears!'</p>

<p>Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride</p>

<p>Of the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay, As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side</p>

<p>He wound with toilsome march his long array: Stout Glo'ster stood aghast in speechless trance; 'To arms!' cried Mortimer, and couch'd his quivering lance.</p>

<p>On a rock, whose haughty brow Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,</p>

<p>Robed in the sable garb of woe With haggard eyes the Poet stood; (Loose his beard and hoary hair Stream'd like a meteor to the troubled air) And with a master's hand and prophet's fire Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre:</p>

<p>'Hark, how each giant-oak and desert-cave Sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath! O'er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave</p>

<p>Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe; Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day, To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay.</p>

<p>'Cold is Cadwallo's tongue,</p>

<p>That hush'd the stormy main: Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:</p>

<p>Mountains, ye mourn in vain</p>

<p>Modred, whose magic song Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head.</p>

<p>On dreary Arvon's shore they lie Smear'd with gore and ghastly pale: Far, far aloof the affrighted ravens sail;</p>

<p>The famish'd eagle screams, and passes by. Dear lost companions of my tuneful art,</p>

<p>Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes, Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart,</p>

<p>Ye died amidst your dying country's cries No more I weep; They do not sleep;</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>On yonder cliffs, a griesly band, I see them sit; They linger yet,</p>

<p>Avengers of their native land: With me in dreadful harmony they join, And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line.'</p>

<p>Weave the warp and weave the woof</p>

<p>The winding sheet of Edward's race: Give ample room and verge enough</p>

<p>The characters of hell to trace. Mark the year, and mark the night, When Severn shall re-echo with affright The shrieks of death thro' Berkley's roof that ring, Shrieks of an agonizing king!</p>

<p>She-wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate,</p>

<p>From thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs The scourge of Heaven! What terrors round him wait Amazement in his van, with Flight combined, And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind.</p>

<p>'Mighty victor, mighty lord,</p>

<p>Low on his funeral couch he lies! No pitying heart, no eye, afford</p>

<p>A tear to grace his obsequies. Is the sable warrior fled? Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead. The swarm that in thy noon-tide beam were born? Gone to salute the rising morn. Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the zephyr blows,</p>

<p>While proudly riding o'er the azure realm In gallant trim the gilded Vessel goes:</p>

<p>Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm: Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway, That hush'd in grim repose expects his evening prey.</p>

<p>'Fill high the sparkling bowl, The rich repast prepare;</p>

<p>Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast: Close by the regal chair</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Fell Thirst and Famine scowl</p>

<p>A baleful smile upon their baffled guest. Heard ye the din of battle bray,</p>

<p>Lance to lance, and horse to horse?</p>

<p>Long years of havock urge their destined course, And thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way.</p>

<p>Ye towers of Julius, London's lasdng shame, With many a foul and midnight murder fed,</p>

<p>Revere hisConsort's faith, his Father's fame, And spare the meek usurper's holy head! Above, below, the rose of snow,</p>

<p>Twined with her blushing foe, we spread: The bristled boar in infant-gore</p>

<p>Wallows beneath the thorny shade. Now, brothers, bending o'er the accursed loom, Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.</p>

<p>'Edward, lo! to sudden fate</p>

<p>(Weave we the woof; The thread is spun;) Half of thy heart we consecrate.</p>

<p>(The web is wove; The work is done.) Stay, oh stay! nor thus forlorn Leave me unbless'd, unpitied, here to mourn: In yon bright track that fires the western skies They melt, they vanish from my eyes. But O! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height</p>

<p>Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll? Visions of glory, spare my aching sight, Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul! No more our long-lost Arthur we bewail: All hail, ye genuine kings! Britannia's issue, hail!</p>

<p>'Girt with many a baron bold</p>

<p>Sublime their starry fronts they rear;</p>

<p>And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old</p>

<p>In bearded majesty, appear.</p>

<p>In the midst a form divine!</p>

<p>Her eye proclaims her of the Briton-Line:</p>

<p>Her lion-port, her awe-commanding face</p>

<p>Attemper'd sweet to virgin-grace.</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>What strings symphonious tremble in the air, What strains of vocal transport round her play?</p>

<p>Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear; They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.</p>

<p>Bright Rapture calls, and soaring as she sings,</p>

<p>Waves in the eye of Heaven her many-coloured wings.</p>

<p>The verse adorn again</p>

<p>Fierce War, and faithful Love, And Truth severe, by fairy Fiction drest.</p>

<p>In buskin'd measures move Pale Grief, and pleasing Pain, With Horror, tyrant of the throbbing breast. A voice as of the cherub-choir</p>

<p>Gales from blooming Eden bear,</p>

<p>And distant warblings lessen on my ear That lost in long futurity expire. Fond impious man, think'st thou yon sanguine cloud</p>

<p>Raised by thy breath, has quench'd the orb of day ? To-morrow he repairs the golden flood</p>

<p>And warms the nations with redoubled ray. Enough for me: with joy I see</p>

<p>The different doom-our fates assign: Be thine Despair and sceptred Care,</p>

<p>To triumph and to die are mine.' He spoke, and headlong from the mountain's height Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night.</p>

<p>Ode on the Pleasure Arising from Vicissitude</p>

<p>Now the golden Morn aloft</p>

<p>Waves her dew-bespangled wing, With vermeil cheek and whisper soft</p>

<p>She woos the tardy Spring: Till April starts, and calls around The sleeping fragrance from the ground, And lightly o'er the living scene Scatters his freshest, tenderest green.</p>

<p>New-born flocks, in rustic dance, Frisking ply their feeble feet;</p>

<p>THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>Forgetful of their wintry trance The birds his presence greet: But chief, the sky-lark warbles high His trembling thrilling ecstasy; And lessening from the dazzled sight, Melts into air and liquid light.</p>

<p>Yesterday the sullen year</p>

<p>Saw the snowy whirlwind fly; Mute was the music of the air, The herd stood drooping by; Their raptures now that wildly flow No yesterday nor morrow know; 'Tis Man alone that joy descries With forward and reverted eyes.</p>

<p>Smiles on past Misfortune's brow Soft Reflection's hand can trace, And o'er the cheek of Sorrow throw</p>

<p>A melancholy grace; While Hope prolongs our happier hour, Or deepest shades, that dimly lour And blacken round our weary way, Gilds with a gleam of distant day.</p>

<p>Still, where rosy Pleasure leads,</p>

<p>See a kindred Grief pursue; Behind the steps that Misery treads</p>

<p>Approaching Comfort view: The hues of bliss more brighdy glow Chastised by sabler tints of woe, And blended form, with artful strife, The strength and harmony of life.</p>

<p>See the wretch that long has tost On the thorny bed of pain,</p>

<p>At length repair his vigour lost And breathe and walk again:</p>

<p>The meanest floweret of the vale,</p>

<p>The simplest note that swells the gale,</p>

<p>462 THOMAS GRAY</p>

<p>The common sun, the air, the skies, To him are opening Paradise.</p>

<p>292 On a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of</p>

<p>Gold Fishes</p>

<p>'Twas on a lofty vase's side, Where China's gayest art had dyed The azure flowers that blow, Demurest of the tabby kind The pensive Selima, reclined, Gazed on the lake below.</p>

<p>Her conscious tail her joy declared: The fair round face, the snowy beard, The velvet of her paws, Her coat that with the tortoise vies, Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes She saw, and purr'd applause.</p>

<p>Still had she gazed, but 'midst the tide Two angel forms were seen to glide, The Genii of the stream: Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue Through richest purple, to the view Betray'd a golden gleam.</p>

<p>The hapless Nymph with wonder saw:</p>

<p>A whisker first, and then a claw</p>

<p>With many an ardent wish</p>

<p>She stretch'd, in vain, to reach the prize</p>

<p>What female heart can gold despise ?</p>

<p>What Cat's averse to fish?</p>

<p>Presumptuous maid! with looks intent Again she stretch'd, again she bent, Nor knew the gulf between Malignant Fate sat by and smiled The slippery verge her feet beguiled; She tumbled headlong in!</p>

<p>GEORGE BUBB DODINGTON</p>

<p>463</p>

<p>Eight times emerging from the flood She mew'd to every watery God Some speedy aid to send: No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirr'd. Nor cruel Tom nor Susan heard A favourite has no friend!</p>

<p>From hence, ye Beauties! undeceived Know one false step is ne'er retrieved, And be with caution bold: Not all that tempts your wandering eyes And heedless hearts, is lawful prize, Nor all that glisters, gold!</p>
