<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>Much of the life of Dante Alighieri is obscure, and the known facts are surrounded by a haze of legend and conjecture. He was born in Florence in 1265, of a family noble but not wealthy. His early education is a matter of inference, but we know that he learned the art of writing verse from the poets of France and Provence, and that after he reached manhood he devoted much time to study and became profoundly learned. As a young man he saw military service and shared in the recreations of his contemporaries; and he married some time before he was thirty-two. In Dante's day politics in Florence were exciting and dangerous; and after a few years of participation in public affairs he was condemned to death by his political enemies in 1302. He saved himself by exile, and never returned to his native town. The rest of his life was mainly spent wandering about the north of Italy, in Verona, Bologna, Pisa, Lucca, and finally Ravenna, where he died in 1321. During the years of his exile he found generous patrons in men like the heads of the Scala family in Verona and Guido Novello da Polenta in Ravenna; and at Bologna and elsewhere he was welcomed as a teacher.</p>

<p>In the early part of the century in which Dante was born, the literary language of Tuscany was still Latin, and not the least of his services to his country was his influence in finally establishing the dignity of Italian as a medium for great literature. He himself used Latin in at least three works: his lecture "De Aqua et Terra"; his "De Monarchia," in which he expounded his political theory of the relation of the Empire and the Papacy; and his unfinished "De Vulgari Eloquentia," containing his defense of the use of Italian. More important, however, were his two great works in the vernacular, the "Vita Nuova," a series of poems with prose commentary, on his love for Beatrice, and the "Divina Commedia."</p>

<p>The Beatrice, real or ideal, who plays so important a part in the poetry of Dante, is stated by Boccaccio to have been the daughter of Folco Portinari, a rich Florentine, and wife of the banker Simone dei Bardi. With this actual person Dante's acquaintance seems to have been of the slightest; but, after the fashion of the chivalric lovers of the day, he took her as the object of his ideal devotion. She became for him, especially after her death in 1290, the center of a mystical devotion of extraordinary intensity, and appears in his masterpiece as the personification of heavenly enlightenment.</p>

<p>The "Divine Comedy" was entitled by Dante himself merely "Com-</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>4 INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>media," "meaning a poetic composition in a style intermediate between the sustained nobility of tragedy, and the popular tone of elegy." The word had no dramatic implication at that time, though it did involve a happy ending. The poem is the narrative of a journey down through Hell, up the mountain of Purgatory, and through the revolving heavens into the presence of God. In this aspect it belongs to the two familiar medieval literary types of the Journey and the Vision. It is also an allegory, representing under the symbolism of the stages and experiences of the journey, the history of a human soul, painfully struggling from sin through purification to the Beatific Vision. Other schemes of interpretation have been worked out and were probably intended, for Dante granted the medieval demand for a threefold and even fourfold signification in this type of writing.</p>

<p>But the "Divine Comedy" belongs to still other literary forms than those mentioned. Professor Grandgent has pointed out that it is also an encyclopedia, a poem in praise of Woman, and an autobiography. It contains much of what Dante knew of theology and philosophy, of astronomy and cosmography, and fragments of a number of other branches of learning, so that its encyclopedic character is obvious. In making it a monument to Beatrice, he surpassed infinitely all the poetry devoted to the praise of women in an age when the deification of women was the commonplace of poetry. And finally he made it an autobiography not a narrative of the external events of his life, but of the agony of his soul.</p>

<p>Thus, in an altogether unique way, Dante summarizes the literature, the philosophy, the science, and the religion of the Middle Ages. Through the intensity of his capacity for experience, the splendor of his power of expression, and the depth of his spiritual and philosophic insight, he at once sums up and transcends a whole era of human history.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>INFERNO [HELL] CANTO I</p>

<p>Argument.The writer, having lost his way in a gloomy forest, and being hindered by certain wild beasts from ascending a mountain, is met by Virgil, who promises to show him the punishments of Hell, and afterward of Purgatory; and that he shall then be conducted by Beatrice into Paradise. He follows the Roman poet.</p>

<p>IN the midway' of this our mortal life, I found me in a gloomy wood, astray Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell, It were no easy task, how savage wild That forest, how robust and rough its growth, Which to remember only, my dismay Renews, in bitterness not far from death. Yet, to discourse of what there good befel, All else will I relate discover'd there.</p>

<p>How first I enter'd it I scarce can say, Such sleepy dulness in that instant weigh'd My senses down, when the true path I left; But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where closed The valley that had pierced my heart with dread, I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad Already vested with that planet's beam,2 Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.</p>

<p>Then was a little respite to the fear, That in my heart's recesses deep had lain All of that night, so pitifully past: And as a man, with difficult short breath, Forespent with toiling, 'scaped from sea to shore, Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands</p>

<p>At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd, Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits That none hath passed and lived. My weary frame After short pause recomforted, again I journey'd on over that lonely steep, The hinder foot3 still firmer. Scarce the ascent Began, when, lo! a panther,4 nimble, light, And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd; Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd; rather strove To check my onward going; that oft-times, With purpose to retrace my steps, I turn'd.</p>

<p>The hour was morning's prime, and on his way Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,5 That with him rose when Love Divine first moved Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope All things conspired to fill me, the gay skin Of that swift animal, the matin dawn, And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chased. And by new dread succeeded, when in view A lion came, 'gainst me as it appear'd, With his head held aloft and hunger-mad, That e'en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd Full of all wants, and many a land hath made Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear O'erwhelm'd me, at the sight of her appall'd, That of the height all hope I lost. As one, Who, with his gain elated, sees the time When all unawares is gone, he inwardly Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I, Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace, Who coming o'er against me, by degrees Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.</p>

<p>While to the lower space with backward step I fell, my ken discern'd the form of one Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech. When him in that great desert I espied,</p>

<p>"Have mercy on me," cried I out aloud, "Spirit! or living man! whate'er thou be."</p>

<p>He answered: "Now not man, man once I was, And born of Lombard parents, Mantuans both By country, when the power of Julius yet Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past, Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time Of fabled deities and false. A bard Was I, and made Anchises' upright son The subject of my song, who came from Troy, When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers. But thou, say wherefore to such perils past Return'st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?" "And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring, From which such copious floods of eloquence Have issued?" I with front abash'd replied. "Glory and light of all the tuneful train! May it avail me, that I long with zeal Have sought thy volume, and with love immense Have conn'd it o'er. My master thou, and guide! Thou he from whom alone I have derived That style, which for its beauty into fame Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled. O save me from her, thou illustrious sage! For every vein and pulse throughout my frame She hath made tremble." He, soon as he saw That I was weeping, answer'd, "Thou must needs Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape From out that savage wilderness. This beast, At whom thou criest, her way will surfer none To pass, and no less hinderance makes than death: So bad and so accursed in her kind, That never sated is her ravenous will, Still after food more craving than before. To many an animal in wedlock vile She fastens, and shall yet to many more, Until that greyhound8 come, who shall destroy</p>

He will not life support By earth nor its base metals, but by love, Wisdom, and virtue; and his land shall be The land 'twixt either Feltro.7 In his might Shall safety to Italia's plains arise, For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure, Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell. He, with incessant chase, through every town Shall worry, until he to hell at length Restore her, thence by envy first let loose. I, for thy profit pondering, now devise That thou mayst follow me; and I, thy guide, Will lead thee hence through an eternal space, Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see Spirits of old tormented, who invoke A second death;8 and those next view, who dwell Content in fire,9 for that they hope to come, Whene'er the time may be, among the blest, Into whose regions if thou then desire To ascend, a spirit worthier10 than I Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart, Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King, Who reigns above, a rebel to His law Adjudges me; and therefore hath decreed That, to His city, none through me should come. He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds His citadel and throne. O happy those, Whom there He chuses!" I to him in few: "Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore, I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse I may escape) to lead me where thou said'st, That I Saint Peter's gate" may view, and those Who, as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight."

<p>Argument.After the invocation, which poets are used to prefix to their works, he shows that, on a consideration of his own strength, he doubted whether it sufficed for the journey proposed to him, but that, being comforted by Virgil, he at last took courage, and followed him as his guide and master.</p>

<p>NOW was the day departing, and the air, Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils released All animals on earth; and I alone Prepared myself the conflict to sustain, Both of sad pity, and that perilous road, Which my unerring memory shall retrace.</p>

Yet if Heaven's great Lord, Almighty foe to ill, such favor show'd In contemplation of the high effect, Both what and who from him should issue forth, It seems in reason's judgment well deserved; Sith he of Rome and of Rome's empire wide, In Heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire: Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd And stablish'd for the holy place, where sits Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds. He from this journey, in thy song renown'd, Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise And to the papal robe.

Those things alone Are to be fear'd whence evil may proceed; None else, for none are terrible beside. I am so framed by God, thanks to His grace! That any sufferance of your misery Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire Assails me.

At her word Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe, And coming to the place, where I abode Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days, She thus address'd me: "Thou true praise of God! Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent To him, who so much loved thee, as to leave For thy sake all the multitude admires?

<p>HELL</p>

<p>13</p>

<p>CANTO III</p>

<p>Argument.Dante, following Virgil, comes to the gate of Hell; where, after having read the dreadful words that are written thereon, they both enter. Here, as he understands from Virgil, those were punished who had passed their time (for living it could not be called) in a state of apathy and indifference both to good and evil. Then, pursuing their way, they arrive at the river Acheron; and there find the old ferryman Charon, who takes the spirits over to the opposite shore; which, as toon as Dante reaches, he is seized with terror, and falls into a trance.</p>

<p>THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe: I    Through me you pass into eternal pain: J    Through me among the people lost for aye-Justice the founder of my fabric moved: To rear me was the task of Power divine, Supremest Wisdom, and primeval Love.' Before me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon, ye who enter here."</p>

<p>Such characters, in color dim, I mark'd Over a portal's lofty arch inscribed. Whereat I thus: "Master, these words import Hard meaning." He as one prepared replied: "Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave; Here be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come Where I have told thee we shall see the souls To misery doom'd, who intellectual good Have lost." And when his hand he had stretch'd forth To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd, Into that secret place he led me on.</p>

<p>Here sighs, with lamentations and loud moans, Resounded through the air pierced by no star, That e'en I wept at entering. Various tongues, Horrible languages, outcries of woe, Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse, With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds, Made up a tumult, that forever whirls Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd, Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.</p>

<p>I then, with horror yet encompast, cried: "O master! what is this I hear? what race Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?" 1 "Power," "Wisdom," "Love," the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity.</p>

<p>14 THE DIVINE COMEDY canto hi</p>

<p>He thus to me: "This miserable fate Suffer the wretched souls of those, who lived Without or praise or blame, with that ill band Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious proved, Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth Not to impair his lustre; nor the depth Of Hell receives them, lest the accursed tribe Should glory thence with exultation vain."</p>

<p>I then: "Master! what doth aggrieve them thus, That they lament so loud?" He straight replied: "That will I tell thee briefly. These of death No hope may entertain: and their blind life So meanly passes, that all other lots They envy. Fame of them the world hath none, Nor suffers; Mercy and Justice scorn them both. Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by."</p>

<p>And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag, Which whirling ran around so rapidly, That it no pause obtain'd: and following came Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er Have thought that death so many had despoil'd.</p>

<p>When some of these I recognized, I saw And knew the shade of him, who to base fear1 Yielding, abjured his high estate. Forthwith I understood, for certain, this the tribe Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing And to His foes. These wretches, who ne'er lived, Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks With blood, that, mix'd with tears, dropp'd to their feet, And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>15</p>

<p>A throng upon the shore of a great stream: Whereat I thus: "Sir! grant me now to know Whom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem So eager to pass o'er, as I discern Through the blear light?" He thus to me in few: "This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive Beside the woful tide of Acheron."</p>

<p>Then with eyes downward cast, and fill'd with shame, Fearing my words offensive to his ear, Till we had reach'd the river, I from speech Abstain'd. And lo! toward us in a bark Comes on an old man, hoary white with eld, Crying, "Woe to you, wicked spirits! hope not Ever to see the sky again. I come To take you to the other shore across, Into eternal darkness, there to dwell In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave These who are dead." But soon as he beheld I left them not, "By other way," said he, "By other haven shalt thou come to shore, Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat Must carry." Then to him thus spake my guide: "Charon! thyself torment not: so 'tis will'd, Where will and power are one: ask thou no more."</p>

<p>Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks Of him, the boatman o'er the livid lake, Around whose eyes glared wheeling flames. Meanwhile Those spirits, faint and naked, color changed, And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words They heard. God and their parents they blasphemed, The human kind, the place, the time, and seed, That did engender them and give them birth,</p>

<p>Then all together sorely wailing drew To the curst strand, that every man must pass Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form, With eyes of burning coal, collects them all, Beckoning, and each, that lingers, with his oar Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves One still another following, till the bough</p>

<p>Strews all its honours on the earth beneath; E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood Cast themselves, one by one, down from the shore, Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.3</p>

<p>Thus go they over through the umber'd wave; And ever they on the opposing bank Be landed, on this side another throng Still gathers. "Son," thus spake the courteous guide, "Those who die subject to the wrath of God All here together come from every clime And to o'erpass the river are not loth: For so Heaven's justice goads them on, that fear Is turn'd into desire. Hence ne'er hath past Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain, Now mayst thou know the import of his words."</p>

<p>This said, the gloomy region trembling shook So terribly, that yet with clammy dews Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast, That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame, Which all my senses conquer'd quite, and I Down dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seized.</p>

<p>CANTO IV</p>

<p>Argument.The Poet, being roused by a clap of thunder, and following his guide onward, descends into Limbo, which is the first circle of Hell, where he finds the souls of those, who, although they have lived virtuously and have not to suffer for great sins, nevertheless, through lack of baptism, merit not the bliss of Paradise. Hence he is led on by Virgil to descend into the second circle.</p>

<p>BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself, As one by main force roused. Risen upright, My rested eyes I moved around, and search'd With fixed ken, to know what place it was Wherein I stood. For certain, on the brink I found me of the lamentable vale, The dread abyss, that joins a thundrous sound Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,</p>

<p>And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain Explored its bottom, nor could aught discern.</p>

<p>"Now let us to the blind world there beneath Descend," the bard began, all pale of look: "I go the first, and thou shalt follow next."</p>

<p>Then I, his alter'd hue perceiving, thus: "How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread, Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?"</p>

<p>He then: "The anguish of that race below With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way Urges to haste." Onward, this said, he moved; And entering led me with him, on the bounds Of the first circle that surrounds the abyss.</p>

<p>Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard Except of sighs, that made the eternal air Tremble, not caused by tortures, but from grief Felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and infants. Then to me The gende guide: "Inquirest thou not what spirits Are these which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin Were blameless; and if aught they merited, It profits not, since baptism was not theirs, The portal1 to thy faith. If they before The Gospel lived, they served not God aright; And among such am I. For these defects, And for no other evil, we are lost; Only so far afflicted, that we live Desiring without hope." Sore grief assail'd My heart at hearing this, for well I knew Suspended in that Limbo many a soul Of mighty worth. "O tell me, sire revered! Tell me, my master!" I began, through wish Of full assurance in that holy faith Which vanquishes all error; "say, did e'er Any, or through his own or other's merit,</p>

<p>1 "Portal." "Porta delta fede." This thority, as it would appear, of only two was an alteration made in the text by the manuscripts. The other reading is, "parte Academicians della Crusca, on the au-   delta fede," "part of the faith."</p>

<p>Piercing the secret purport* of my speech, He answer'd: "I was new to that estate When I beheld a puissant one3 arrive Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd. He forth the shade of our first parent drew, Abel, his child, and Noah righteous man, Of Moses lawgiver for faith approved, Of patriarch Abraham, and David king, Israel with his sire and with his sons, Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won, And others many more, whom He to bliss Exalted.

<p>He answer'd: "The renown of their great names, That echoes through your world above, acquires Favor in Heaven, which holds them thus advanced." Meantime a voice I heard: "Honor the bard Sublime! his shade returns, that left us late!" No sooner ceased the sound, than I beheld Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps, Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.</p>

<p>When they together short discourse had held, They turn'd to me, with salutation kind Beckoning me; at the which my master smiled: Nor was this all; but greater honour still They gave me, for they made me of their tribe; And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.</p>

<p>Far as the luminous beacon on we pass'd, Speaking of matters, then befitting well To speak, now fitter left untold.

<p>canto v HELL 21</p>

<p>CANTO V</p>

<p>Argument.Coming into the second circle of Hell, Dante at the entrance beholds Minos the Infernal Judge, by whom he is admonished to beware how he enters those regions. Here he witnesses the punishment of carnal sinners, who are tossed about ceaselessly in the dark air by the most furious winds. Among these, he meets with Francesca of Rimini, through pity at whose sad tale he falls fainting to the ground.</p>

<p>FROM the first circle I descended thus Down to the second, which, a lesser space Embracing, so much more of grief contains, Provoking bitter moans. There Minos stands, Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all Who enter, strict examining the crimes, Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath, According as he foldeth him around: For when before him comes the ill-fated soul, It all confesses; and that judge severe Of sins, considering what place in Hell Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft Himself encircles, as degrees beneath He dooms it to descend. Before him stand Always a numerous throng; and in his turn Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd. "O thou! who to this residence of woe Approachest!" when he saw me coming, cried Minos, relinquishing his dread employ, "Look how thou enter here; beware in whom Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad Deceive thee to thy harm." To him my guide: "Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way By destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd, Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more."</p>

<p>Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard. Now am I come where many a plaining voice Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan'd A noise, as of a sea in tempest torn By warring winds. The stormy blast of Hell With restless fury drives the spirits on, Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto v</p>

<p>When they arrive before the ruinous sweep, There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans, And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in Heaven. I understood, that to this torment sad The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom Reason by lust is sway'd. As, in large troops And multitudinous, when winter reigns, The starlings on their wings are borne abroad; So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls. On this side and on that, above, below, It drives them: hope of rest to solace them Is none, nor e'en of milder pang. As cranes, Chanting their dolorous notes, traverse the sky, Stretch'd out in long array; so I beheld Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on By their dire doom. Then I: "Instructor! who Are these, by the black air so scourged?" "The first 'Mong those, of whom thou question'st," he replied, "O'er many tongues was empress. She in vice Of luxury was so shameless, that she made Liking be lawful by promulged decree, To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd. This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ, That she succeeded Ninus her espoused; And held the land, which now the Soldan rules. The next in amorous fury slew herself, And to Sichams' ashes broke her faith: Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen."</p>

<p>There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long The time was fraught with evil; there the great Achilles, who with love fought to the end. Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside, A thousand more he show'd me, and by name Pointed them out, whom love bereaved of life.</p>

<p>When I had heard my sage instructor name Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind Was lost; and I began: "Bard! willingly I would address those two together coming, Which seem so light before the wind." He thus:</p>

<p>CANTO v HELL 23</p>

<p>1 "The land." Ravenna.</p>

<p>1 "Ca'ina." The place to which murderers are doomed.</p>

<p>"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach. Then by that love which carries them along, Entreat; and they will come." Soon as the wind Sway'd them towards us, I thus framed my speech: "O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse With us, if by none else restrain'd." As doves By fond desire invited, on wide wings And firm, to their sweet nest returning home, Cleave the air, wafted by their will along; Thus issued, from that troop where Dido ranks, They, through the ill air speeding: with such force My cry prevail'd, by strong affection urged.</p>

<p>"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st Visiting, through this element obscure, Us, who the world with bloody stain imbrued; If, for a friend, the King of all, we own'd, Our prayer to him should for thy peace arise, Since thou hast pity on our evil plight. Of whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind, As now, is mute. The land,' that gave me birth, Is situate on the coast, where Po descends To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.</p>

<p>"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt, Entangled him by that fair form, from me Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still: Love, that denial takes from none beloved, Caught me with pleasing him so passing well, That, as thou seest, he yet deserts me not. Love brought us to one death: Cai'na1 waits The soul, who spilt our life." Such were their words; At hearing which, downward I bent my looks, And held them there so long, that the bard cried: "What art thou pondering?" I in answer thus: "Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire Must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!"</p>

<p>Then turning, I to them my speech address'd,</p>

<p>24</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto v</p>

<p>And thus began: "Francesca!' your sad fate Even to tears my grief and pity moves. But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs, By what, and how Love granted, that ye knew Your yet uncertain wishes?" She replied: "No greater grief than to remember days Of joy, when misery is at hand. That kens Thy learn'd instructor. Yet so eagerly If thou art bent to know the primal root, From whence our love gat being, I will do As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day, For our delight we read of Lancelot,4 How him love thrall'd. Alone we were, and no Suspicion near us. Oft-times by that reading Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue Fled from our alter'd cheek. But at one point Alone we fell. When of that smile we read, The wished smile so rapturously kiss'd By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er From me shall separate, at once my lips All trembling kiss'd. The book and writer both Were love's purveyors. In its leaves that day We read no more." While thus one spirit spake, The other wail'd so sorely, that heart-struck I, through compassion fainting, seem'd not far From death, and like a corse fell to the ground.</p>

<p>* "Francesca." Francesca, the daughter of Guido da Polenta, Lord of Ravenna, was given by her father in marriage to Gianciotto, son of Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, a man of extraordinary courage, but deformed in his person. His brother Paolo, who unhappily possessed those graces which the husband of Francesca wanted, engaged her affections; and being</p>

<p>taken in adultery, they were both put to death by the enraged Gianciotto.</p>

<p>4 "Lancelot." One of the Knights of the Round Table, and the lover of Gincvra, or Guinever, celebrated in romance. The incident alluded to seems to have made a strong impression on the imagination of Dante, who introduces it again, in the Paradise, Canto xvi.</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>25</p>

<p>CANTO VI</p>

<p>Argument.On his recovery, the Poet finds himself in the third circle, where the gluttonous are punished. Their torment is, to lie in the mire, under a continual and heavy storm of hail, snow, and discolored water; Cerberus, meanwhile barking over them with his threefold throat, and rending them piecemeal. One of these, who on earth was named Ciacco, foretells the divisions with which Florence is about to be distracted. Dante proposes a question to his guide, who solves it; and they proceed toward the fourth circle.</p>

<p>MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see New torments, new tormented souls, which way Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight. In the third circle I arrive, of showers Ceaseless, accursed, heavy and cold, unchanged For ever, both in kind and in degree. Large hail, discolor'd water, sleety flaw Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain: Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.</p>

<p>Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange, Through his wide threefold throat, barks as a dog Over the multitude immersed beneath. His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard, His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs Piecemeal disparts. Howling there spread, as curs, Under the rainy deluge, with one side The other screening, oft they roll them round, A wretched, godless crew. When that great worm1 Descried us, savage Cerberus, he oped His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb Of him but trembled. Then my guide, his palms Expanding on the ground, thence fill'd with earth Raised them, and cast it in his ravenous maw. E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall His fury, bent alone with eager haste</p>

<p>To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks Of demon Cerberus, who thundering stuns The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.</p>

<p>We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.</p>

<p>They all along the earth extended lay, Save one, that sudden raised himself to sit, Soon as that way he saw us pass. "O thou!" He cried, "who through the infernal shades art led, Own, if again thou know'st me. Thou wast framed Or ere my frame was broken." I replied: "The anguish thou endurest perchance so takes Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems As if I saw thee never. But inform Me who thou art, that in a place so sad Art set, and in such torment, that although Other be greater, none disgusteth more." He thus in answer to my words rejoin'd: "Thy city, heap'd with envy to the brim, Aye, that the measure overflows its bounds, Held me in brighter days. Ye citizens Were wont to name me Ciacco.2 For the sin Of gluttony, damned vice, beneath this rain, E'en as thou seest, I with fatigue am worn: Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment."</p>

<p>No more he said, and I my speech resumed: "Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much, Even to tears. But tell me, if thou know'st, What shall at length befall the citizens Of the divided city;3 whether any Just one inhabit there: and tell the cause, Whence jarring Discord hath assail'd it thus."</p>

<p>He then: "After long striving they will come</p>

<p>This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance, A litde eyed me, then bent down his head, And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.</p>

<p>When thus my guide: "No more his bed he leaves, Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. The Power Adverse to these shall then in glory come, Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair, Resume his fleshly vesture and his form, And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend The vault." So pass'd we through that mixture foul Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile Touching, though slightly, on the life to come. For thus I question'd: "Shall these tortures, Sir I When the great sentence passes, be increased, Or mitigated, or as now severe?"</p>

<p>He then: "Consult thy knowledge; that decides, That, as each thing to more perfection grows, It feels more sensibly both good and pain. Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive This race accurst, yet nearer then, than now, They shall approach it." Compassing that path, Circuitous we journey'd; and discourse, Much more than I relate, between us pass'd: Till at the point, whence the steps led below, Arrived, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.</p>

<p>CANTO VII</p>

<p>Argument.In the present Canto, Dante describes his descent into the fourth</p>

<p>circle, at the beginning of which he sees Plutus stationed. Here one like doom awaits the prodigal and the avaricious; which is, to meet in direful conflict, rolling great weights against each other with mutual upbraidings. From hence Virgil takes occasion to show how vain the goods that are committed into the charge of Fortune; and this moves our author to inquire what being that Fortune is, of whom he speaks: which question being resolved, they go down into the fifth circle, where they find the wrathful and gloomy tormented in the Stygian lake. Having made a compass round great part of this lake, they come at last to the base of a lofty tower.</p>

<p>H me! O Satan! Satan!"1 loud exdaim'd Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:</p>

<p>__And the kind sage, whom no event surprised,</p>

<p>To comfort me thus spake: "Let not thy fear Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none '"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, aleppe;" words without meaning.</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."</p>

<p>Then to that swoln lip turning, "Peace!" he cried,</p>

<p>"Curst wolf! thy fury inward on thyself</p>

<p>Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound,</p>

<p>Not without cause, he passes. So 'tis will'd</p>

<p>On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd</p>

<p>As sails, full spread and bellying with the wind, Drop suddenly collapsed, if the mast split; So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.</p>

<p>Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge, Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe Hems in of all the universe. Ah me! Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld. Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?</p>

<p>E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising, Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks; Such is the dance this wretched race must lead, Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found. From one side and the other, with loud voice, Both roll'd on weights, by main force of their breasts, Then smote together, and each one forthwith Roll'd them back voluble, turning again; Exclaiming these, "Why holdest thou so fast?" Those answering, "And why easiest thou away?" So, still repeating their despiteful song, They to the opposite point, on either hand, Traversed the horrid circle; then arrived, Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space, Conflicting met again. At sight whereof I, stung with grief, thus spake: "O say, my guide! What race is this. Were these, whose heads are shorn, On our left hand, all separate to the Church?"</p>

<p>He straight replied: "In their first life, these all In mind were so distorted, that they made, According to due measure, of their wealth No use. This clearly from their words collect, Which they howl forth, at each extremity Arriving of the circle, where their crime</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto vii</p>

<p>Contrary in kind disparts them. To the Church Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls Are crowned, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom Avarice dominion absolute maintains."</p>

<p>I then: " 'Mid such as these some needs must be, Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot Of these foul sins were stain'd." He answering thus: "Vain thought conceivest thou. That ignoble life, Which made them vile before, now makes them dark, And to all knowledge indiscernible. For ever they shall meet in this rude shock: These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise, Those with close-shaven locks. That ill they gave, And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world Deprived, and set them at this strife, which needs No labor'd phrase of mine to set it off. Now mayst thou see, my son! how brief, how vain, The goods committed into Fortune's hands, For which the human race keep such a coil! Not all the gold that is beneath the moon, Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls Might purchase rest for one." I thus rejoin'd: "My guide! of these this also would I learn; This Fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is, Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world."</p>

<p>He thus: "O beings blind! what ignorance Besets you! Now my judgment hear and mark. He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all, The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers To guide them; so that each part shines to each, Their light in equal distribution pour'd. By similar appointment he ordain'd, Over the world's bright images to rule, Superintendence of a guiding hand And general minister, which, at due time, May change the empty vantages of life From race to race, from one to other's blood, Beyond prevention of man's wisest care: Wherefore one nation rises into sway, Another languishes, e'en as her will</p>

<p>Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe</p>

<p>Descending: for each star is falling now,</p>

<p>That mounted at our entrance, and forbids</p>

<p>Too long our tarrying." We the circle cross'd</p>

<p>To the next steep, arriving at a well,</p>

<p>That boiling pours itself down to a foss</p>

<p>Sluiced from its source. Far murkier was the wave</p>

<p>Than sablest grain: and we in company</p>

<p>Of the inky waters, journeying by their side,</p>

<p>Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.</p>

<p>Into a lake, the Stygian named, expands</p>

<p>The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot</p>

<p>Of the gray wither'd cliffs. Intent I stood</p>

<p>To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried</p>

<p>A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks</p>

<p>Betokening rage. They with their hands alone</p>

<p>Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,</p>

<p>Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.</p>

<p>The good instructor spake: "Now seest thou, son! The souls of those, whom anger overcame. This too for certain know, that underneath The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs Into these bubbles make the surface heave, As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn. Fix'd in the slime, they say: 'Sad once were we, In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto viii</p>

<p>Carrying a foul and lazy mist within: Now in these murky settlings are we sad.' Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats, But word distinct can utter none." Our route Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd Between the dry embankment, and the core Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees; Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.</p>

<p>CANTO VIII</p>

<p>Argument.A signal having been made from the tower, Phlegyas, the ferryman of the lake, speedily crosses it, and conveys Virgil and Dante to the other side. On their passage, they meet with Filippo Argenti, whose fury and torment are described. They then arrive at the city of Dis, the entrance whereto is denied, and the portals closed against them by many Demons.</p>

<p>MY theme pursuing, I relate, that ere We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes Its height ascended, where we mark'd uphung Two cressets, and another saw from far Return the signal, so remote, that scarce The eye could catch its beam. I, turning round To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquired: "Say what this means; and what, that other light In answer set: what agency doth this?"</p>

<p>"There on the filthy waters," he replied, "E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see, If the marsh-gendered fog conceal it not."</p>

<p>Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd, That ran its way so nimbly through the air, As a small bark, that through the waves I spied Toward us coming, under the sole sway Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud: "Art thou arrived, fell spirit?""Phlegyas, Phlegyas,1 This time thou criest in vain," my lord replied; "No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er The slimy pool we pass." As one who hears Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat</p>

<p>1 Phlegyas, so incensed against Apollo by whose vengeance he was cast into for having violated his daughter Coronis, Tartarus. See Virgil, /Eneas, 1. vi. 618. that he set fire to the temple of that deity,</p>

<p>CANTO VIII</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>Inly he pines: so Phlegyas inly pined</p>

<p>In his fierce ire. My guide, descending, stepp'd</p>

<p>Into the skiff, and bade me enter next,</p>

<p>Close at his side; nor, till my entrance, seem'd</p>

<p>The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark'd,</p>

<p>Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,</p>

<p>More deeply than with others it is wont.</p>

<p>While we our course o'er the dead channel held, One drench'd in mire before me came, and said: "Who art thou, that thus comest ere thine hour?"</p>

<p>I answer'd: "Though I come, I tarry not: But who art thou, that art become so foul?"</p>

<p>"One, as thou seest, who mourn:" he straight replied.</p>

<p>To which I thus: "In mourning and in woe, Curst spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well, E'en thus in filth disguised." Then stretch'd he forth Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage Aware, thrusting him back: "Away! down there To the other dogs!" then, with his arms my neck Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: "O soul, Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom Thou wast conceived. He in the world was one For arrogance noted: to his memory No virtue lends its lustre; even so Here is his shadow furious. There above, How many now hold themselves mighty kings, Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire, Leaving behind them horrible dispraise."</p>

<p>I then: "Master! him fain would I behold Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake."</p>

<p>He thus: "Or ever to thy view the shore Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish, Which well deserves completion." Scarce his words Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes Set on him with such violence, that yet For that render I thanks to God, and praise. "To Filippo Argenti!"J cried they all: * Boccaccio tells us, "he was a man re-  and the extreme waywardness and ir</p>

<p>And on himself the moody Florentine Turn'd his avenging fangs. Him here we left, Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear Sudden a sound of lamentation smote, Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.</p>

<p>And thus the good instructor: "Now, my son Draws near the city, that of Dis is named, With its grave denizens, a mighty throng."</p>

<p>I thus: "The minarets already, Sir! There, certes, in the valley I descry, Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire Had issued." He replied: "Eternal fire, That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame Illumed; as in this nether Hell thou seest."</p>

<p>We came within the fosses deep, that moat This region comfortless.  The walls appear'd As they were framed of iron.  We had made Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud The mariner cried vehement: "Go forth: The entrance is here." Upon the gates I spied More than a thousand, w ho of old from Heaven Were shower'd.  With ireful gestures, "Who is this," They cried, "that, without death first felt, goes through The regions of the dead?" My sapient guide Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd; Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus They spake: "Come thou alone; and let him go, Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm. Alone return he by his widess way; If well he knew it, let him prove. For thee, Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark Hast been his escort."  Now bethink thee, readerl What cheer was mine at sound of those curst words. I did believe I never should return.</p>

<p>"O my loved guide 1 who more than seven times'</p>

<p>* "Seven times." The commentators, says Venturi, perplex themselves with the inquiry what seven perils these were from which Dante had been delivered by Virgil. Reckoning the beasts in the first Canto as one of them, and adding Charon,</p>

<p>Minos, Cerberus, Plutus, Phlegyas, and Filippo Argenti, as so many others, we shall have the number; and if this be not satisfactory, we may suppose a determinate to have been put for an indeterminate number.</p>

<p>canto viii</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>35</p>

<p>Security hast render'd me, and drawn From peril deep, whereto I stood exposed, Desert me not," I cried, "in this extreme. And, if our onward going be denied, Together trace we back our steps with speed."</p>

<p>My liege, who thither had conducted me, Replied: "Fear not: for of our passage none Hath power to disappoint us, by such high Authority permitted.  But do thou Expect me here; meanwhile, thy wearied spirit Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assured I will not leave thee in this lower world." This said, departs the sire benevolent, And quits me. Hesitating I remain At war, 'twixt will and will not, in my thoughts.</p>

<p>I could not hear what terms he offer'd them, But they conferr'd not long, for all at once Pellmell rush'd back within. Closed were the gates, By those our adversaries, on the breast Of my liege lord: excluded, he return'd To me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground His eyes were bent, and from his brow erased All confidence, while thus in sighs he spake: "Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?" Then thus to me: "That I am anger'd, think No ground of terror: in this trial I Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within For hindrance. This their insolence, not new,4 Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd, Which still is without bolt; upon its arch Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now, On this side of its entrance, down the steep, Passing the circles, unescorted, comes One whose strong might can open us this land."</p>

<p>4 Virgil assures our poet that these evil spirits had formerly shown the same insolence when our Saviour descended into hell. They attempted to prevent him from entering at the gate, over which</p>

<p>Dante had read the fatal inscription. "That gate which," says the Roman poet, "an angel had just passed, by whose aid we shall overcome this opposition, and gain admittance into the city."</p>

<p>36</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto ix</p>

<p>CANTO IX</p>

<p>Argument.After some hindrances, and having seen the hellish furies and other monsters, the Poet, by the help of an angel, enters the city of Dis, wherein he discovers that the heretics are punished in tombs burning with intense fire; and he, together with Virgil, passes onward between the sepulchres and the walls of the city.</p>

<p>THE hue,1 which coward dread on my pale cheeks Imprinted when I saw my guide turn back, Chased that from his which newly they had worn, And inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye Not (ar could lead him through the sable air, And the thick-gathering cloud. "It yet behoves Wr win this fight;" thus he began: "if not, Such aid to us is offer'dOh! how long Me seems it, ere the promised help arrive."</p>

<p>I noted, how the sequel of his words Cloked their beginning; for the last he spake Agreed not with the first. But not the less My fear was at his saying; sith I drew To import worse, perchance, than that he held, His mutilated speech.  "Doth ever any Into this rueful concave's extreme depth Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?"</p>

<p>Thus I inquiring.  "Rarely," he replied, "It chances, that among us any makes This journey, which I wend.  Erewhile, 'tis true, Once came I here beneath, conjured by fell Erichtho,2 sorceress, who compell'd the shades Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh Was naked of me, when within these walls She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit From out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place Is that of all, obscurest, and removed</p>

<p>1 "The hue." Virgil, perceiving that Dante was pale with fear, restrained those outward tokens of displeasure which his own countenance had betrayed.</p>

<p>* Erichtho, a Thessalian sorceress (Lucan, "Pharsal." I. vi.), was employed by Sextus, son of Pompey the Great, to conjure up a spirit, who should inform him of the issue of the civil wars between his father and Casar.</p>

<p>canto ix</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>Farthest from Heaven's all-circling orb.  The road Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure. That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round The city of grief encompasses, which now We may not enter without rage." Yet more He added: but I hold it not in mind, For that mine eye toward the lofty tower Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top; Where, in an instant, I beheld uprisen At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood. In limb and motion feminine they seem'd; Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.</p>

<p>He, knowing well the miserable hags Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake: "Mark thou each dire Erynnis. To the left, This is Megaera; on the right hand, she Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone I' th' midst." This said, in silence he remain'd. Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves Smote with their palms, and such thrill clamour raised, That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound. "Hasten Medusa: so to adamant Him shall we change;" all looking down exclaim'd: "E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took No ill revenge." "Turn thyself round and keep Thy countenance hid; for if the Gorgon dire Be shown, and thoa shouldst view it, thy return Upwards would be forever lost." This said, Himself, my gentle master, turn'd me round; Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own He also hid me.  Ye of intellect Sound and entire, mark well the lore' conceal'd</p>

<p>' The Poet probably intends to call the perance, reason, figured under the person reader's attention to the allegorical and of Virgil, with the ordinary grace of God, mystic sense of the present Canto, and may be a sufficient safeguard; but that not, as Venturi supposes, to that of the in the instance of more heinous crimes, whole work. Landino supposes this hid- such as those we shall hereafter see pun-den meaning to be that in the case of ished, a special grace, represented by the those vices which proceed from intern- angel, is requisite for our defence.</p>

<p>4 "Your Cerberus." Cerberus is feigned to have been dragged by Hercules, bound with a threefold chain, of which, says the angel, he still bears the marks. Lombardi blames the other interpreters for having supposed that the angel attributes this</p>

<p>exploit to Hercules, a fabulous hero, rather than to our Saviour. It would seem as if the good father had forgotten that Cerberus is himself no less a creature of the imagination than the hero who encountered him.</p>

<p>Under close texture of the mystic strain.</p>

<p>And now there came o'er the perturbed waves Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made Either shore tremble, as if of a wind Impetuous, from conflicting vapors sprung, That 'gainst some forest driving all his might, Plucks off the branches, beats them down, and hurls Afar; then, onward passing, proudly sweeps His whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.</p>

<p>Mine eyes he loosed, and spake: "And now direct Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam, There, thickest where the smoke ascends." As frogs Before their foe the serpent, through the wave Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound. He, from his face removing the gross air, Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone By that annoyance wearied.  I perceived That he was sent from Heaven; and to my guide Turn'd me, who signal made, that I should stand Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full Of noble anger seem'd he.  To the gate He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat Open without impediment it flew.</p>

<p>"Outcasts of heaven! O abject race, scorn'd!" Began he, on the horrid grunsel standing, "Whence doth this wild excess of insolence Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs? What profits at the Fates to butt the horn? Your Cerberus,4 if ye remember, hence Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw."</p>

Then we our steps Toward that territory moved, secure After the hallow'd words. We, unopposed, There enter'd; and, my mind eager to learn What state a fortress like to that might hold, I, soon as enter'd, throw mine eye around, And see, on every part, wide-stretching space, Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.</p>

<p>Their lids all hung suspended; and beneath, From them forth issued lamentable moans, Such as the sad and tortured well might raise.</p>

<p>I thus: "Master! say who are these, interr'd Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear The dolorous sighs." He answer thus return'd: "The arch-heretics are here, accompanied By every sect their followers; and much more Than thou believest, the tombs are freighted: like With like is buried; and the monuments Are different in degrees of heat."

<p>Where is my son?* and wherefore not with thee?" I straight replied:   "Not of myself I come; By him, who there expects me, through this clime Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son Had in contempt." 7 Already had his words And mode of punishment read me his name, Whence I so fully answer'd.  He at once Exclaim'd, up starting, "How! said'st thou, he had? No longer lives he?   Strikes not on his eye The blessed daylight?"  Then, of some delay I made ere my reply, aware, down fell Supine, nor after forth appear'd he more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom I yet was station'd, changed not countenance stern, Nor moved the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.

But not yet fifty times8 shall be relumed Her aspect, who reigns here queen of this realm,* Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.

Sighing he shook The head, then thus resumed:  "In that affray I stood not singly, nor, without just cause, Assuredly, should with the rest have stirr'd; But singly there I stood,12 when, by consent Of all, Florence had to the ground been razed, The one who openly forbade the deed."</p>

<p>"So may thy lineage find at last repose," I thus adjured him, "as thou solve this knot, Which now involves my mind.  If right I hear, Ye seem to view beforehand that which time Leads with him, of the present uninform'd."</p>

<p>"We view, as one who hath an evil sight," He answer'd, "plainly, objects far remote; So much of his large splendor yet imparts The Almighty Ruler: but when they approach, Or actually exist, our intellect Then wholly fails; nor of your human state, Except what others bring us, know we aught. Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all Our knowledge in that instant shall expire, When on futurity the portals close."</p>

<p>Then conscious of my fault,13 and by remorse Smitten, I added thus: "Now shalt thou say To him there fallen, that his offspring still Is to the living join'd; and bid him know, That if from answer, silent, I abstain'd,</p>

<p>" "Such orisons." This appears to allude to certain prayers which were offered up in the churches of Florence, for deliverance from the hostile attempts of the Uberti; or, it may be that the public councils being held in churches, the speeches delivered in them against the Uberti are termed "orisons," or prayers.</p>

<p>11 "Singly there I stood." Guido Novcllo assembled a council of the Ghibellini at Empoli; where it was agreed by all, that, in order to maintain the ascendancy of the Ghibellinc party in Tuscany, it was necessary to destroy Florence, which could serve only (the people of that city being Guelfi) to enable the party attached to</p>

<p>the church to recover its strength. This cruel sentence, passed upon so noble a city, met with no opposition from any of its citizens or friends, except Farinata degli Uberti, who openly and without reserve forbade the measure; affirming, that he had endured so many hardships, with no other view than that of being able to pass his days in his own country. Macchiavclli, Hist, of Flor. b. ii.</p>

<p>13 "My fault." Dante felt remorse for not having returned an immediate answer to the inquiry of Cavalcante, from which delay he was led to believe that his son Guido was no longer living.</p>

<p>But now my master summoning me back I heard, and with more eager haste besought The spirit to inform me, who with him Partook his lot.  He answer thus return'd: "More than a thousand with me here are laid. Within is Frederick,14 second of that name, And the Lord Cardinal,15 and of the rest I speak not."  He, this said, from sight withdrew. But I my steps toward the ancient bard Reverting, ruminated on the words Betokening me such ill. Onward he moved, And thus, in going, question'd:  "Whence the amaze That holds thy senses wrapt?"   I satisfied The inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight: "Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard, To thee importing harm; and note thou this," With his raised finger bidding me take heed, "When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam," Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life The future tenor will to thee unfold."</p>

<p>Argument.Dante arrives at the verge of a rocky precipice which encloses the seventh circle, where he sees the sepulchre of Anastasius the Heretic; behind the lid of which pausing a little, to make himself capable by degrees of enduring the fetid smell that steamed upward from the abyss, he is instructed by Virgil concerning the manner in which the three following circles are disposed, and what description of sinners is punished in each. He then inquires the reason why the carnal, the gluttonous, the avaricious and prodigal, the wrathful and gloomy, suffer not their punishments within the city of Dis. He next asks how the crime of usury is an offence against God; and at length the two Poets go toward the place from whence a passage leads down to the seventh circle.</p>

<p>UPON the utmost verge of a high bank, By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came. Where woes beneath, more cruel yet, were stow'd:</p>

<p>And here, to shun the horrible excess</p>

<p>Of fetid exhalation upward cast</p>

<p>From the profound abyss, behind the lid</p>

<p>Of a great monument we stood retired,</p>

<p>Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how</p>

And if it be not, wherefore in such guise Are they condemn'd?"  He answer thus return'd: "Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind, Not so accustom'd ? or what other thoughts Possess it?

<p>Argument.Descending by a very rugged way into the seventh circle, where the violent are punished, Dante and his leader find it guarded by the Minotaur; whose fury being pacified by Virgil, they step downward from crag to crag; till, drawing near the bottom, they descry a river of blood, wherein are tormented such as have committed violence against their neighbor. At these, when they strive to emerge from the blood, a troop of Centaurs, running along the side of the river, aim their arrows; and three of their band opposing our travellers at the foot of the steep, Virgil prevails so far that one consents to carry them both across the stream; and on their passage, Dante is informed by him of the course of the river, and of those that are punished therein.</p>

Thus down our road we took Through those dilapidated crags, that oft Moved underneath my feet, to weight like theirs Unused.  I pondering went, and thus he spake: "Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep, Guarded by the brute violence, which I Have vanquish'd now.

<p>Such trembling seized the deep concave and foul, I thought the universe was thrill'd with love, Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft Been into chaos turn'd: and in that point, Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down. But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd, Who have by violence injured." O blind lustl O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on In the brief life, and in the eternal then Thus miserably o'erwhelm us.   I beheld An ample foss, that in a bow was bent, As circling all the plain; for so my guide Had told. Between it and the rampart's base, On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd, As to the chase they on the earth were wont.</p>

<p>At seeing us descend they each one stood; And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows And missile weapons chosen first; of whom One cried from far:   "Say, to what pain ye come Condemn'd, who down this steep have journey'd. Speak From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw."</p>

<p>To whom my guide: "Our answer shall be made To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come. Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash." Then me he touch'd and spake:  "Nessus is this, Who for the fair Deianira died, And wrought himself revenge7 for his own fate. He in the midst, that on his breast looks down, Is the great Chiron who Achilles nursed; That other, Pholus, prone to wrath." Around The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts At whatsoever spirit dares emerge From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.</p>

<p>We to those beasts, that rapid strode along, Drew near; when Chiron took an arrow forth,</p>

<p>* Nessus, when dying by the hand of Hercules, charged Deianira to preserve the gore from his wound; for that if the affections of Hercules should at any time be estranged from her, it would recall</p>

<p>them. Deianira had occasion to try the experiment; and the venom, as Nessus had intended, caused Hercules to expire in torments.</p>

<p>Moves what he touches?  The feet of the dead</p>

<p>Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,</p>

<p>Thus made reply:   "He is indeed alive,</p>

<p>And solitary so must needs by me</p>

<p>Who to the ford may lead us, and convey</p>

<p>Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus To Nessus spake: "Return, and be their guide. And if ye chance to cross another troop, Command them keep aloof." Onward we moved, The faithful escort by our side, along The border of the crimson-seething flood, Whence, from those steep'd within, loud shrieks arose.</p>

<p>Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow Immersed, of whom the mighty Centaur thus: "These are the souls of tyrants, who were given To blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud Their merciless wrongs. Here Alexander dwells, And Dionysius fell, who many a year Of woe wrought for fair Sicily.

Among the former, Picro dclle Vigne is one who tells him the cause of his having committed suicide, and moreover in what manner the souls are transformed into those trunks. Of the latter crew, he recognizes Lano, a Siennese, and Giacomo, a Paduan; and lastly, a Florentine, who had hung himself from his own roof, speaks to him of the calamities of his countrymen.</p>

<p>ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank, We enter'd on a forest, where no track Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these, Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide Those animals, that hate the cultured fields, Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.1</p>

Broad are their pennons, of the human form Their neck and countenance, arm'd with talons keen The feet, and the huge belly fledged with wings. These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.</p>

<p>The thought thou hast conceived shall vanish quite."</p>

<p>Thereat a litde stretching forth my hand, From a great wilding gather'd I a branch, And straight the trunk exclaim'd: "Why pluck'st thou me?"</p>

<p>Then, as the dark blood trickled down its side,</p>

<p>These words it added: "Wherefore tear'st me thus?</p>

<p>Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?</p>

<p>Men once were we, that now are rooted here.</p>

<p>First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words Were ended, then to me the bard began: "Lose not the time; but speak, and of him ask, If more thou wish to learn." Whence I replied: "Question thou him again of whatsoe'er Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power Have I to ask, such pity is at my heart."</p>

<p>He thus resumed:  "So may he do for thee Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet Be pleased, imprison'd spirit! to declare, How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied; And whether any ever from such frame Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell."</p>

<p>Thereat the trunk breathed hard, and the wind soon Changed into sounds articulate like these: "Briefly ye shall be answer'd.  When departs The fierce soul from the body, by itself Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls, No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance</p>

<p>Attentive yet to listen to the trunk We stood, expecting further speech, when us A noise surprised; as when a man perceives The wild boar and the hunt approach his place Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs Loud rustling round him hears. And lo! there came Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight, That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood. "Haste now," the foremost cried, "now haste thee, death!"</p>

<p>The other, as seem'd, impatient of delay, Exclaiming, "Lano!3 not so bent for speed Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field." And then, for that perchance no longer breath Sufficed him, of himself and of a bush One group he made.   Behind them was the wood Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet, As greyhounds that have newly slipt the leash. On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs, And having rent him piecemeal bore away The tortured limbs. My guide then seized my hand, And led me to the thicket, which in vain Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: "O Giacomo Of Sant' Andrea!' what avails it thee," * Lano, a Sicnncsc, who being reduced    tain death, in the engagement which took by prodigality to a state of extreme want,    place at Toppo, near Arezzo.

<p>When o'er it he had paused, my master spake: "Say who wast thou, that at so many points Breathest out with blood thy lamentable speech?"</p>

<p>He answer'd:  "O ye spirits! arrived in time To spy the shameful havoc that from me My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up, And at the foot of their sad parent-tree Carefully lay them.  In that city5 I dwelt, Who for the Baptist her first patron changed, Whence he for this shall cease not with his art To work her woe: and if there still remain'd not On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him, Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls Upon the ashes left by Attila, Had labor'd without profit of their toil. I slung the fatal noose6 from my own roof."</p>

<p>CANTO XIV</p>

<p>Argument.They arrive at the beginning of the third of those compartments into which this seventh circle is divided. It is a plain of dry and hot sand, where three kinds of violence are punished; namely, against God, against Nature, and against Art; and those who have thus sinned, are tormented by flakes of fire, which are eternally showering down upon them. Among the violent against God is found Capaneus, whose blasphemies they hear. Next, turning to the left along the forest of self-slayers, and having journeyed a little onward, they meet with a streamlet of blood that issues from the forest and traverses the sandy plain. Here Virgil speaks to our Poet of a huge ancient statue that stands within Mount Ida in Crete, from a fissure in which statue there is a dripping of tears, from which the said streamlet, together with the three other infernal rivers, are formed.</p>

<p>Contrivance horrible. Things then first seen Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round Its garland on all sides, as round the wood Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge, Our steps we stay'd. It was an area wide Of arid sand and thick, resembling most The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod. Vengeance of heaven!  Ohl how shouldst thou be fear'd</p>

<p>By all, who read what here mine eyes beheld.</p>

<p>Of naked spirits many a flock I saw, All weeping piteously, to different laws Subjected; for on the earth some lay supine, Some crouching close were seated, others paced Incessantly around; the latter tribe More numerous, those fewer who beneath The torment lay, but louder in their grief.</p>

<p>O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd. As, in the torrid Indian clime, the son Of Ammon saw, upon his warrior band Descending, solid flames, that to the ground Came down; whence he bethought him with his troop To trample on the soil; for easier thus The vapor was extinguish'd, while alone: So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith The marie glow'd underneath, as under stove The viands, doubly to augment the pain. Unceasing was the play of wretched hands, Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off The heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began: "Instructor! thou who all things overcomest, Except the hardy demons that rush'd forth To stop our entrance at the gate, say who Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn, As by the sultry tempest immatured?"</p>

<p>Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd My guide of him, exclaim'd:   "Such as I was When living, dead such now I am.  If Jove Weary his workman out, from whom in ire He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day Transfix'd me; if the rest he weary out, At their black smithy laboring by turns, In Mongibello, while he cries aloud, 'Help, help, good Mulciber!' as erst he cried In the Phlegrxan warfare; and the bolts Launch he, full aim'd at me, with all his might; He never should enjoy a sweet revenge."</p>

<p>Then thus my guide, in accent higher raised Than I before had heard him: "Capaneus! Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride Lives yet unquench'd: no torment, save thy rage, Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."</p>

<p>Next turning round to me, with milder lip He spake:   "This of the seven kings was one, Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held, As still he seems to hold, God in disdain, And sets His high omnipotence at naught. But, as I told him, his despiteful mood Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it. Follow me now; and look thou set not yet Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood Keep ever close."   Silently on we pass'd To where there gushes from the forest's bound A litde brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts My hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs From Bulicame,1 to be portion'd out Among the sinful women, so ran this Down through the sand; its bottom and each bank Stone-built, and either margin at its side, Whereon I straight perceived our passage lay.</p>

<p>As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,</p>

<p>O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."</p>

<p>So spake my guide; and I him thence besought, That having given me appetite to know, The food he too would give, that hunger craved.</p>

<p>"In midst of ocean," forthwith he began, "A desolate country lies, which Crete is named; Under whose monarch, in old times, the world Lived pure and chaste. A mountain rises there, Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams, Deserted now like a forbidden thing. It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse, Chose for the secret cradle of her son; And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts His infant cries.  Within the mount, upright An ancient form there stands, and huge, that turns His shoulders toward Damiata; and at Rome, As in his mirror, looks. Of finest gold His head is shaped, pure silver are the breast And arms, thence to the middle is of brass, And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel, Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which Than on the other more erect he stands. Each part, except the gold, is rent throughout; And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd Penetrate to that cave.  They in their course, Thus far precipitated down the rock, Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon; Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence Beneath e'en to the lowest depth of all, Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself Shalt see it) I here give thee no account."</p>

<p>Then I to him:  "If from our world this sluice Be thus derived; wherefore to us but now Appears it at this edge?"  He straight replied: "The place, thou know'st, is round: and though great part</p>

<p>Thou have already past, still to the left Descending to the nethermost, not yet</p>

<p>Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb. Wherefore, if aught of new to us appear, It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks."</p>

<p>Then I again inquired:  "Where flow the streams Of Phlegcthon and Lethe? for of one Thou tell'st not; and the other, of that shower, Thou say'st, is form'd." He answer thus reiurn'd: "Doubtless thy questions all well pleased I hear. Yet the red seething wave2 might have resolved One thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see, But not within this hollow, in the place Whither,3 to lave themselves, the spirits go, Whose blame hath been by penitence removed." He added:   "Time is now we quit the wood. Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames; For over them all vapor is extinct."</p>

<p>Argument.Taking their way upon one of the mounds by which the streamlet, spoken of in the last Canto, was embanked, and having gone so far that they could no longer have discerned the forest if they had turned round to look for it, they meet a troop of spirits that come along the sand by the side of the pier. These arc they who have done violence to Nature; and among them Dante distinguishes Brunetto Latini, who had been formerly his master; with whom, turning a little backward, he holds a discourse which occupies the remainder of this Canto.</p>

<p>ONE of the solid margins bears us now Envelop'd in the mist, that, from the stream Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire Both piers and water.  As the Flemings rear Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide That drives toward them; or the Paduans theirs Along the Brenta, to defend their towns And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt On Chiarentana's1 top; such were the mounds, So framed, though not in height or bulk to these Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er</p>

<p>He was, that raised them here. We from the wood Were now so far removed, that turning round I might not have discern'd it, when we met A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.</p>

<p>They each one eyed us, as at eventide One eyes another under a new moon; And toward us sharpen'd their sight, as keen As an old tailor at his needle's eye.</p>

<p>Thus narrowly explored by all the tribe, I was agnized of one, who by the skirt Caught me, and cried, "What wonder have we here?"</p>

<p>And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm, Intendy fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks, That, although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not But I remember'd him; and toward his face My hand inclining, answer'd:   "Ser Brunetto!2 And are ye here?"  He thus to me:  "My son! Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto Latini but a little space with thee Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed."</p>

<p>I thus to him replied:   "Much as I can, I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing That I here seat me with thee, I consent; His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd."</p>

<p>"O son!" said he, "whoever of this throng One instant stops, lies then a hundred years, No fan to ventilate him, when the fire Smitest sorest. Pass thou therefore on. I close Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin My troop, who go mourning their endless doom."</p>

<p>I dared not from the path descend to tread On equal ground with him, but held my head Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.</p>

<p>"What chance or destiny," thus he began, "Ere the last day, conducts thee here below? And who is this that shows to thee the way?"</p>

<p>"If thou," he answer'd, "follow but thy star, Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven; Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd. And if my fate so early had not chanced, Seeing the heavens thus bounteous to thee, I Had gladly given thee comfort in thy work. But that ungrateful and malignant race, Who in old times came down from Fesole, Ay and still smack of their rough mountain flint, Will for thy good deeds show thee enmity. Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savor'd crabs It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit. Old fame reports them in the world for blind, Covetous, envious, proud.  Look to it well: Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.  For thee, Thy fortune hath such honor in reserve, That thou by either party shalt be craved With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far From the goat's tooth.  The herd of Fesole May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant, If any such yet spring on their rank bed, In which the holy seed revives, transmitted From those true Romans, who still there remain'd, When it was made the nest of so much ill."</p>

<p>"Were all my wish fulfill'd," I straight replied, "Thou from the confines of man's nature yet Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart, The dear, benign, paternal image, such As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me The way for man to win eternity: And how I prized the lesson, it behoves, That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak. What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down;</p>

<p>4 "Francesco." Accorso, a Florentine, interpreted the Roman law at Bologna, and died in 1229, at the age of 78. His authority was so great as to exceed that of all the other interpreters, so that Cino da Pistoia termed him the Idol of Advocates. His sepulchre, and that of his son Francesco here spoken of, is at Bologna,</p>

<p>with this short epitaph: "Sepulcrum Accursii Glossatoris el Francisci ens Filii."</p>

<p>5 "Him." Andrea de' Mozzi, who, that his scandalous life might be less exposed to observation, was translated either by Nicholas III or Boniface VIII from the see of Florence to that of Vicenza, through which passes the river Bacchiglione. He died at Vicenza.</p>

<p>And, with another text* to comment on, For her I keep it, the celestial dame, Who will know all, if I to her arrive. This only would I have thee clearly note: That, so my conscience have no plea against me, Do Fortune as she list, I stand prepared. Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear. Speed Fortune then her wheel, as likes her best; The clown his mattock; all things have their course."</p>

<p>Thereat my sapient guide upon his right Turn'd himself back, then looked at me, and spake: "He listens to good purpose who takes note."</p>

<p>I not the less still on my way proceed, Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire Who are most known and chief among his tribe.</p>

<p>"To know of some is well;" he thus replied, "But of the rest silence may best beseem. Time would not serve us for report so long. In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks, Men of great learning and no less renown, By one same sin polluted in the world. With them is Priscian; and Accorso's son, Francesco,4 herds among the wretched throng: And, if the wish of so impure a blotch Possess'd thee, him5 thou also mightst have seen, Who by the servants' servant was transferr'd From Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where His ill-strain'd nerves he left. I more would add, But must from further speech and onward way Alike desist; for yonder I behold A mist new-risen on the sandy plain. A company, with whom I may not sort,</p>

<p>CANTO XVI</p>

<p>Argument.Journeying along the pier, which crosses the sand, they are now so near the end of it as to hear the noise of the stream falling into the eighth circle, when they meet the spirits of three military men; who judging Dante, from his dress, to be a countryman of theirs, entreat him to stop. He complies and speaks with them. The two Poets then reach the place where the water descends, being the termination of this third compartment in the seventh circle; and here Virgil, having thrown down into the hollow a cord, wherewith Dante was girt, they behold at that signal a monstrous and horrible figure come swimming up to them.</p>

<p>NOW came I where the water's din was heard As down it fell into the other round, Resounding like the hum of swarming bees: irth together issued from a troop, That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm, Three spirits, running swift. They toward us came, And each one cried aloud, "Oh! do thou stay, Whom, by the fashion of thy garb, we deem To be some inmate of our evil land."</p>

<p>Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs, Recent and old, inflicted by the flames. E'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.</p>

<p>Attentive to their cry, my teacher paused, And turned to me his visage, and then spake: "Wait now: our courtesy these merit well: And were't not for the nature of the place, Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said, That haste had better suited thee than them."</p>

<p>They, when we stopp'd, resumed their ancient wail, And, soon as they had reach'd us, all the three Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel. As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil Are wont, intent, to watch their place of hold And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;</p>

<p>"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs," He answer straight return'd; "and so thy fame Shine bright when thou art gone, as thou shalt tell, If courtesy and valor, as they wont, Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean: For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail, Borsiere,4 yonder walking with his peers, Grieves us no little by the news he brings."</p>

<p>Not in so short a time might one have said "Amen," as they had vanish'd.  Straight my guide Pursued his track. I follow'd: and small space Had we past onward, when the water's sound Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce Heard one another's speech for the loud din.</p>

<p>E'en as the river,* that first holds its course Unmingled from the Mount of Vesulo, On the left side of Apennine, toward The east, which Acquacheta higher up They call, ere it descend into the vale, At Forli,7 by that name no longer known, Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on From the Alpine summit down a precipice, Where space* enough to lodge a thousand spreads; Thus downward from a craggy steep we found That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud, So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.</p>

<p>I had a cord9 that braced my girdle round, Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take The painted leopard. This when I had all Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade) I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him. Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink Standing few paces distant, cast it down Into the deep abyss. "And somewhat strange," Thus to myself I spake, "signal so strange Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye Thus follows." Ah! what caution must men use</p>

<p>He compares the fall of Phlcgethon to that of the Montone (a river in Romagna) from the Apennines above the Abbey of St. Benedict. All the other streams that rise between the sources of the Po and the Montone, and fall from the left side of the Apennines, join the Po and accompany it to the sea.</p>

<p>7 There it loses the name of Acquacheta, and takes that of Montone.</p>

<p>* Either because the abbey was capable of containing more than those who oc-</p>

<p>cupied it, or because (says Landino) the lords of that territory had intended to build a castle near the water-fall, and to collect within its walls the population of the neighboring villages.</p>

<p>* "A cord." It is believed that our poet in early life, had entered into the order of St. Francis. By observing the rules of that profession he had designed "to take the painted leopard" (that animal represented Pleasure) "with this cord."</p>

<p>69</p>

<p>With those who look not at the deed alone, But spy into the thoughts with subde skill.</p>

<p>"Quickly shall come," he said, "what I expect; Thine eye discover quickly that, whereof Thy thought is dreaming." Ever to that truth, Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears, A man, if possible, should bar his lip; Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach. But silence here were vain; and by these notes, Which now I sing, reader, I swear to thee, So may they favor find to latest times! That through the gross and murky air I spied A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd The stoutest heart with wonder; in such guise As one returns, who hath been down to loose An anchor grappled fast against some rock, Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies, Who, upward springing, close draws in his feet.</p>

<p>CANTO XVII</p>

<p>Argument.The monster Gcryon is described; to whom while Virgil is speaking in order that he may carry them both down to the next circle, Dante, by permission, goes further along the edge of the void, to descry the third species of sinners contained in this compartment, namely, those who have done violence to Art; and then returning to his master, they both descend, seated on the back of Geryon.</p>

<p>""W"OI the fell monster1 with the deadly sting,</p>

<p>I       Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced I   J   walls And firm embatded spears, and with his filth Taints all the world." Thus me my guide address'd, And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore, Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.</p>

<p>Forthwith that image vile of Fraud appear'd, His head and upper part exposed on land, But laid not on the shore his bestial train. His face the semblance of a just man's wore, So kind and gracious was its outward cheer; The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws 1 "The fell monster." Fraud.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xvii</p>

<p>Reach'd to the arm-pits; and the back and breast,</p>

<p>And either side, were painted o'er with nodes</p>

<p>And orbits. Colours variegated more</p>

<p>Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of siate</p>

<p>With interchangeable embroidery wove,</p>

<p>Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.</p>

<p>As oft-times a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,</p>

<p>Stands part in water, part upon the land;</p>

<p>Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,</p>

<p>The beaver settles, watching for his prey;</p>

<p>So on the rim, that fenced the sand with rock,</p>

<p>Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void</p>

<p>Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,</p>

<p>With sting like scorpion's arm'd. Then thus my guide,</p>

<p>"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,</p>

<p>Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."</p>

<p>Thereat, toward the right our downward course We shaped, and, better to escape the flame And burning marie, ten paces on the verge Proceeded. Soon as we to him arrive, A litde farther on mine eye beholds A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand Near to the void. Forthwith my master spake: "That to the full thy knowledge may extend Of all this round contains, go now, and mark The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse. Till thou returnest, I with him meantime Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe The aid of his strong shoulders."  Thus alone, Yet forward on the extremity I paced Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe Were seated. At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs, Against the vapors and the torrid soil Alternately their shifting hands they plied. Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.</p>

<p>Noting the visages of some, who lay Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire, One of them all I knew not; but perceived,</p>

<p>canto xvn HELL Jl</p>

<p>That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch* With colours and with emblems various mark'd, On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.</p>

<p>And when, amongst them, looking round I came, A yellow purse3 I saw with azure wrought, That wore a lion's countenance and port. Then, still my sight pursuing its career, Another* I beheld, than blood more red, A goose display of whiter wing than curd. And one, who bore a fat and azure swine5 Pictured on his white scrip, address'd me thus: "What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know, Since yet thou livest, that my neighbor here Vitaliano* on my left shall sit. A Paduan with these Florentines am I. Oft-times they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming, 'Oh! haste that noble knight,7 he who the pouch With the three goats will bring.' " This said, he writhed The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox That licks his nostrils. I, lest longer stay He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long, Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.</p>

<p>My guide already seated on the haunch Of the fierce animal I found; and thus He me encouraged.  "Be thou stout: be bold. Down such a steep flight must we now descend. Mount thou before: for, that no power the tail May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst." As one, who hath an ague fit so near, His nails already are turn'd blue, and he Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade; Such was my cheer at hearing of his words. But shame soon interposed her threat, who makes The servant bold in presence of his lord.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xvii</p>

<p>I settled me upon those shoulders huge, And would have said, but that the words to aid My purpose came not, "Look thou clasp me firm."</p>

<p>But he whose succour then not first I proved, Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft, Embracing, held me up; and thus he spake: "Geryon! now move thee: be thy wheeling gyres Of ample circuit, easy thy descent. Think on the unusual burden thou sustain'st."</p>

<p>As a small vessel, backcning out from land, Her station quits; so thence the monster loosed, And, when he felt himself at large, turn'd round There, where the breast had been, his forked tail. Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd, Gathering the air up with retractile claws.</p>

<p>Not greater was the dread, when Phaeton The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven, Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames; Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceived, By liquefaction of the scalded wax, The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins, His sire exclaiming loud, "111 way thou keep'st," Than was my dread, when round me on each part The air I view'd, and other object none Save the fell beast.  He, slowly sailing, wheels His downward motion, unobserved of me, But that the wind, arising to my face, Breathes on me from below.  Now on our right I heard the cataract beneath us leap With hideous crash; whence bending down to explore, New terror I conceived at the steep plunge; For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear: So that, all trembling, close I crouch'd my limbs, And then distinguish'd, unperceived before, By the dread torments that on every side Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.</p>

<p>As falcon, that hath long been on the wing, But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair The falconer cries, "Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth," Wearied descends, whence nimbly he arose</p>

<p>At distance from his lord in angry mood;</p>

<p>So Geryon lighting places us on foot</p>

<p>Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,</p>

<p>And, of his burden there discharged, forthwith</p>

<p>Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.</p>

<p>CANTO XVIII</p>

<p>Argument.The Poet describes the situation and form of the eighth circle, divided into ten gulfs, which contain as many different descriptions of fraudulent sinners; but in the present Canto he treats only of two sorts: the first is of those who, cither for their own pleasure, or for that of another, have seduced any woman from her duty; and these are scourged of demons in the first gulf: the other sort is of flatterers, who in the second gulf arc condemned to remain immersed in filth.</p>

<p>THERE is a place within the depths of Hell Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep That round it circling winds. Right in the midst Of that abominable region yawns A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame Due time shall tell. The circle, that remains, Throughout its round, between the gulf and base Of the high craggy banks, successive forms Ten bastions, in its hollow bottom raised.</p>

<p>As where, to guard the walls, full many a foss Begirds some stately casde, sure defence Affording to the space within; so here Were model'd these: and as like fortresses, E'en from their threshold to the brink without, Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base Thus flinty paths advanced, that 'cross the moles And dykes struck onward far as to the gulf, That in one bound collected cuts them off. Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves From Geryon's back dislodged. The bard to left Held on his way, and I behind him moved.</p>

<p>On our right hand new misery I saw, New pains, new executioners of wrath, That swarming peopled the first chasm. Below Were naked sinners. Hitherward they came,</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xviii</p>

<p>1 In the year 1300, Pope Boniface VIII, to remedy the inconvenience occasioned by the press over the bridge of St. Angclo during the time of the Jubilee, caused it to be divided lengthwise by a partition. G. Villani, who was present, describes the order that was preserved, lib. viii. c. xxxvi.</p>

<p>It was at this time, and on this occasion, that he first conceived the design of "compiling his book."</p>

<p>2 Venedico Caccianimico, a Bolognese, who prevailed on his sister Ghisola to prostitute herself to Obizzo da Este. (See Canto xii.)</p>

<p>Meeting our faces, from the middle point; With us beyond, but with a larger stride. E'en thus the Romans,' when the year returns Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid The thronging multitudes, their means devise For such as pass the bridge; that on one side All front toward the castle, and approach Saint Peter's fane, on the other toward the mount.</p>

<p>Each diverse way, along the grisly rock, Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge, That on their back unmercifully smote. Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripel None for the second waited, nor the third.</p>

<p>Meantime, as on I pass'd, one met my sight, Whom soon as view'd, "Of him," cried I, "not yet Mine eye hath had his fill." 1 therefore stay'd My feet to scan him, and the teacher kind Paused with me, and consented I should walk Backward a space; and the tormented spirit, Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down. But it avail'd him naught; for I exclaim'd: "Thou who dost cast thine eye upon the ground, Unless thy features do belie thee much, Venedico2 art thou. But what brings thee Into this bitter seasoning?" He replied: "Unwillingly I answer to thy words. But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls The world I once inhabited, constrains me. Know then't was I who led fair Ghisola To do the Marquis' will, however fame The shameful tale have bruited. Nor alone Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn. Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd, That not so many tongues this day are taught,</p>

<p>canto xviii</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>75</p>

<p>Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream, To answer Sipa* in their country's phrase. And if of that securer proof thou need, Remember but our craving thirst for gold."</p>

<p>Him speaking thus, a demon with his throng Struck and exclaim'd, "Away, corrupter! here Women are none for sale." Forthwith I join'd My escort, and few paces thence we came To where a rock forth issued from the bank. That easily ascended, to the right Upon its splinter turning, we depart From those eternal barriers. When arrived Where, underneath, the gaping arch lets pass The scourged souls: "Pause here," the teacher said, "And let these others miserable now Strike on thy ken; faces not yet beheld, For that together they with us have walk'd."</p>

<p>From the old bridge we eyed the pack, who came From the other side toward us, like the rest, Excoriate from the lash. My gentle guide, By me unqucstion'd, thus his speech resumed: "Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends, And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear. How yet the regal aspect he retains! Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won The ram from Colchis. To the Lemnian isle His passage thither led him, when those bold And pitiless women had slain all their males. There he with tokens and fair witching words Hypsipyle4 beguiled, a virgin young, Who first had all the rest herself beguiled. Impregnated, he left her there forlorn. Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain. Here too Medea's injuries are avenged. All bear him company, who like deceit To his have practised. And thus much to know</p>

<p>* "To answer Sipa.*' He denotes of the affirmative "sipa" instead either of Bologna by its situation between the rivers    "si" or of "sia."</p>

<p>Savena to the east and Reno to the west, 4 She deceived the other women, by and by a peculiarity of dialect, the use    concealing her father Thoas, when they</p>

<p>slew their males.</p>

<p>* "Thais." In the Eunuchus of Terence, she had expressed her obligation in the Thraso asks if Thais was obliged to him   most forcible terms.</p>

<p>Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those Whom its keen torments urge." Now had we come Where, crossing the next pier, the straiten'd path Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.</p>

<p>Hence, in the second chasm we heard the ghosts, Who gibber in low melancholy sounds, With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves Smite with their palms. Upon the banks a scurf, From the foul steam condensed, encrusting hung, That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.</p>

<p>So hollow is the depth, that from no part, Save on the summit of the rocky span, Could I distinguish aught. Thus far we came; And thence I saw, within the foss below, A crowd immersed in ordure, that appear'd Draff of the human body. There beneath Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd One with his head so grimed, 't were hard to deem If he were clerk or layman. Loud he cried: "Why greedily thus bendest more on me, Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?"</p>

<p>"Because, if true my memory," I replied, "I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks; And thou Alessio5 art, of Lucca sprung. Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more."</p>

<p>Then beating on his brain, these words he spake: "Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk, Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue."</p>

<p>My leader thus: "A little further stretch Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note Of that besotted, sluttish courtesan, Who there doth rend her with defiled nails, Now crouching down, now risen on her feet. Thai's6 is this, the harlot, whose false lip Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd, 'Thankest me much!''Say rather, wondrously,' And, seeing this, here satiate be our view."</p>

<p>CANTO XIX</p>

<p>Argument.They come to the third gulf, wherein arc punished those who have been guilty of simony. These are fixed with the head downward in certain apertures, so that no more of them than the legs appears without, and on the soles of their feet are seen burning flames. Dante is taken down by his guide into the bottom of the gulf; and there finds Pope Nicholas V, whose evil deeds, together with those of other pontiffs, are bitterly reprehended. Virgil then carries him up again to the arch, which affords them a passage over the following gulf.</p>

<p>WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you, His wretched followers! who the things of God, Which should be wedded unto goodness, them, Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute For gold and silver in adultery. Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours Is the third chasm. Upon the following vault We now had mounted, where the rock impends Directly o'er the centre of the foss.</p>

<p>Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art, Which Thou dost manifest in Heaven, in earth, And in the evil world, how just a meed Allotting by Thy virtue unto all.</p>

<p>I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides And in its bottom full of apertures, All equal in their width, and circular each. Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd Than, in Saint John's fair dome1 of me beloved, Those framed to hold the pure baptismal streams, One of the which I brake, some few years past, To save a whelming infant: and be this A seal to undeceive whoever doubts The motive of my deed. From out the mouth Of every one emerged a sinner's feet, And of the legs high upward as the calf. The rest beneath was hid. On either foot The soles were burning; whence the flexile joints Glanced with such violent motion, as had snapt</p>

<p>1 The apertures in the rock were of the same dimensions as the fonts of St. John the Baptist at Florence, one of which Dante had broken to rescue a child that</p>

<p>was playing near and fell in. He intimates that his motive for breaking the font had been maliciously represented by his enemies.</p>

<p>78 THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xix</p>

<p>2 The spirit mistakes Dante for Boniface VIII (who was then alive, and not expected to arrive so soon, a prophecy</p>

<p>predicting the death of that pope at a later period. Boniface died in 1303.</p>

<p>Asunder cords or twisted withes. As flame, Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along The surface, scarcely touching where it moves; So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.</p>

<p>"Master! say who is he, than all the rest Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom A ruddier flame doth prey?" I thus inquired.</p>

<p>"If thou be willing," he replied, "that I Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls, He of himself shall tell thee, and his wrongs."</p>

<p>I then: "As pleases thee, to me is best. Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit Thy will: what silence hides, that knowest thou."</p>

<p>Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd And on our left descended to the depth, A narrow strait, and perforated close. Nor from his side my leader set me down, Till to his orifice he brougiit, whose limb Quivering express'd his pang. "Whoe'er thou art, Sad spirit! thus reversed, and as a stake Driven in the soil,"I in these words began; "If thou be able, utter forth thy voice."</p>

<p>There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive A wretch for murder doom'd, who,e'en when fix'd, Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.</p>

<p>He shouted: "Ha! already standest there? Already standest there, O Boniface!2 By many a year the writing play'd me false. So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth, For which thou fearedst not in guile to take The lovely lady, and then mangle her?"</p>

<p>I felt as those who, piercing not the drift Of answer made them, stand as if exposed In mockery, nor know what to reply; When Virgil thus admonish'd: "Tell him quick, 'I am not he, not he whom thou believest.' "</p>

<p>And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied.</p>

<p>canto xix</p>

<p>HELL</p>

<p>79</p>

<p>That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet, And, sighing, next in woeful accent spake: "What then of me requirest? If to know So much imports thee, who I am, that thou Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn That in the mighty mande I was robed,' And of a she-bear was indeed the son, So eager to advance my whelps, that there My having in my purse above I stow'd, And here myself. Under my head are dragg'd The rest, my predecessors in the guilt Of simony. Stretch'd at their length, they lie Along an opening in the rock. 'Midst them I also low shall fall, soon as he comes, For whom I took thee, when so hastily I question'd. But already longer time Hath past, since my soles kindled, and I thus Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand Planted with fiery feet. For after him, One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive, From forth the west, a shepherd without law,4 Fated to cover both his form and mine. He a new Jason5 shall be call'd, of whom In Maccabees we read; and favor such As to that priest his King indulgent show'd, Shall be of France's monarch6 shown to him."</p>

<p>I know not if I here too far presumed, But in this strain I answer'd: "Tell me now What treasures from Saint Peter at the first Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys Into his charge? Surely he ask'd no more But 'Follow me!' Nor Peter,7 nor the rest,</p>

<p>Or gold or silver of Matthias took, When lots were cast upon the forfeit place Of the condemned soul.8 Abide thou then; Thy punishment of right is merited: And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin, Which against Charles9 thy hardihood inspired. If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not, Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet Severer speech might use. Your avarice O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot Treading the good, and raising bad men up. Of shepherds like to you, the Evangelist Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves, With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld; She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth, And from ten horns her proof of glory drew, Long as her spouse in virtue took delight. Of gold and silver ye have made your god, Differing wherein from the idolater, But that he worships one, a hundred ye? Ah, Constantine!10 to how much ill gave birth, Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower, Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang Spinning on either sole. I do believe My teacher well was pleased, with so composed A lip he listen'd ever to the sound Of the true words I utter'd. In both arms He caught, and, to his bosom lifting me, Upward retraced the way of his descent.</p>

<p>Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path Not easy for the clambering goat to mount. Thence to my view another vale appear'd.</p>

<p>CANTO XX</p>

<p>Argument.The Poet relates the punishment of such as presumed, while living, to predict future events. It is to have their faces reversed and set the contrary way on their limbs, so that, being deprived of the power to see before them, they are constrained ever to walk backward. Among these Virgil points out to him Am-phiaraiis, Tiresias, Aruns, and Manto (from the mention of whom he takes occasion to speak of the origin of Mantua), together with several others, who had practised the arts of divination and astrology.</p>

<p>AND now the verse proceeds to torments new, / \    Fit argument of this the twentieth strain X Of the first song, whose awful theme records</p>

<p>The spirits whelm'd in woe. Earnest I look'd Into the depth, that open'd to my view, Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld A tribe, that came along the hollow vale, In silence weeping: such their step as walk Quires, chanting solemn litanies, on earth.</p>

<p>As on them more direct mine eye descends, Each wonderously seem'd to be reversed At the neck-bone, so that the countenance Was from the reins averted; and because None might before him look, they were compell'd To advance with backward gait. Thus one perhaps Hath been by force of palsy clean transposed, But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.</p>

<p>Now, reader! think within thyself, so God Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld Near me our form distorted in such guise, That on the hinder parts fallen from the face The tears down-streaming roll'd. Against a rock I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd: "What, and art thou, too, witless as the rest? Here pity most doth show herself alive, When she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his, Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?</p>

<p>Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man Before whose eyes' earth gaped in Thebes, when all Cried out 'Amphiaraiis, whither rushest? Why lea vest thou the war?' He not the less Fell ruining far as to Minos down, Whose grapple none eludes. Lo! how he makes The breast his shoulders; and who once too far Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks, And treads reverse his path.

When her sire From life departed, and in servitude The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd, Long time she went a wanderer through the world. Aloft in Italy's delightful land A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp That o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in, Its name Benacus, from whose ample breast A thousand springs, methinks, and more, between Camonica and Garda, issuing forth, Water the Apennine. There is a spot*</p>

These are plunged in a lake of boiling pitch, and guarded by Demons, to whom Virgil, leaving Dante apart, presents himself; and license being obtained to pass onward, both pursue their way.</p>

In the Venetians' arsenal as boils Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear Their unsound vessels; for the inclement time Seafaring men restrains, and in that while His bark one builds anew, another stops The ribs of his that hath made many a voyage, One hammers at the prow, one at the poop, This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls, The mizzen one repairs, and main-sail rent; So, not by force of fire but art divine, Boil'd here a glutinous thick mass, that round Limed all the shore beneath. I that beheld, But therein naught distinguished, save the bubbles Raised by the boiling, and one mighty swell Heave, and by turns subsiding fall. While there I fix'd my ken below, "Mark! mark!" my guide Exclaiming, drew me toward him from the place Wherein I stood. I turn'd myself, as one Impatient to behold that which beheld He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans, That he his flight delays not for the view. Behind me I discern'd a devil black, That running up advanced along the rock. Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake. In act how bitter did he seem, with wings Buoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread. His shoulder, proudly eminent and sharp,</p>

<p>"Ye of our bridge!" he cried, "keen-talon'd fiends! Lo! one of Santa Zita's elders. Him Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more. That land hath store of such. All men are there, Except Bonturo, barterers: of 'no' For lucre there an 'ay' is quickly made."</p>

<p>Him dashing down, o'er the rough rock he turn'd; Nor ever after thief a mastiff loosed Sped with like eager haste. That other sank, And forthwith writhing to the surface rose. But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge, Cried, "Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here Is other swimming than in Serchio's wave, Wherefore, if thou desire we rend thee not, Take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch." This said, They grappled him with more than hundred hooks, And shouted: "Cover'd thou must sport thee here; So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch." E'en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms, To thrust the flesh into the caldron down With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.</p>

<p>Me then my guide bespake: "Lest they descry That thou art here, behind a craggy rock Bend low and screen thee: and whate'er of force Be offer'd me, or insult, fear thou not; For I am well advised, who have been erst In the like fray." Beyond the bridge's head Therewith he pass'd; and reaching the sixth pier, Behoved him then a forehead terror-proof.</p>

<p>With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth Upon the poor man's back, who suddenly From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush'd Those from beneath the arch, and against him Their weapons all they pointed. He, aloud: "Be none of you outrageous: ere your tine Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one, Who having heard my words, decide he then</p>

<p>If he shall tear these limbs." They shouted loud, "Go, Malacoda!" Whereat one advanced, The others standing firm, and as he came, "What may this turn avail him?" he exclaim'd.</p>

<p>"Believest thou, Malacoda! I had come Thus far from all your skirmishing secure," My teacher answer'd, "without will divine And destiny propitious? Pass we then; For so Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead Another through this savage wilderness."</p>

<p>Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop The instrument of torture at his feet, And to the rest exclaim'd: "We have no power To strike him." Then to me my guide: "O thou! Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit Low crouching, safely now to me return."</p>

<p>I rose, and toward him moved with speed; the fiends Meantime all forward drew: me terror seized, Lest they should break the compact they had made. Thus issuing from Caprona,1 once I saw Th' infantry, dreading lest his covenant The foe should break; so close he hemm'd them round.</p>

<p>I to my leader's side adhered, mine eyes With fixt and motionless observance bent On their unkindly visage. They their hooks Protruding, one the other thus bespake: "Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?" To whom Was answer'd: "Even so; nor miss thy aim."</p>

Then to us He added: "Further footing to your step This rock affords not, shiver'd to the base Of the sixth arch.

Thitherward I straight despatch Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy If any on the surface bask. With them Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell. Come, Alichino, forth," with that he cried, "And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou! The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead. With Libicocco, Draghinazzo haste, Fang'd Ciriatta, Graffiacane fierce, And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant. Search ye around the bubbling tar. For these, In safety lead them, where the other crag Uninterrupted traverses the dens."</p>

Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl Threatens us present tortures?" He replied: "I charge thee, fear not: let them, as they will, Gnarl on: 'tis but in token of their spite Against the souls who mourn in torment steep'd."</p>

<p>Arcument.Virgil and Dante proceed, accompanied by the Demons, and see other sinners of the same description in the same gulf. The device of Ciampolo, one of these, to escape from the Demons, who had laid hold on him.</p>

<p>IT hath been heretofore my chance to see Horsemen with martial order shifting camp, To onset sallying, or in muster ranged, Or in retreat sometimes outstretch'd for flight: Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen, And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts, Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells, Tabors,1 or signals made from castled heights, And with inventions multiform, our own, Or introduced from foreign land; but ne'er To such a strange recorder I beheld, In evolution moving, horse nor foot, Nor ship, that tack'd by sign from land or star.</p>

<p>With the ten Demons on our way we went; Ah, fearful company! but in the church With saints, with gluttons at the tavern's mess.</p>

<p>Still earnest on the pitch I gazed, to mark All things whate'er the chasm contain'd, and those Who burn'd within. As dolphins that, in sign To mariners, heave high their arched backs. That thence forewarn'd they may advise to save Their threaten'd vessel; so, at intervals, To case the pain, his back some sinner show'd, Then hid more nimbly than the lightning-glance.</p>

<p>E'en as the frogs, that of a watery moat Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out, Their feet and of the trunk all else conceal'd, Thus on each part the sinners stood; but soon As Barbariccia was at hand, so they Drew back under the wave. I saw, and yet</p>

<p>* His name is said to be Ciampolo.</p>

<p>* "Thibault I, King of Navarre, died on June 8, 1233, as much to be commended for the desire he showed of aiding the war in the Holy Land, as reprehensible and faulty for his design of oppressing the rights and privileges of the Church. Thibault undoubtedly merits praise, as for his other endowments, so especially for</p>

<p>his cultivation of the liberal arts, his exercise and knowledge of music and poetry, in which he so much excelled that he was accustomed to compose verses and sing them to the viol, and to exhibit his poetical compositions publicly in his palace, that they might be criticised by all."</p>

<p>My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus, As it befalls that oft one frog remains, While the next springs away: and Graffiacan, Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seized His clotted locks, and dragg'd him sprawling up, That he appear'd to me an otter. Each Already by their names I knew, so well When they were chosen I observed, and mark'd How one the other call'd. "O Rubicantl See that his hide thou with thy talons flay," Shouted together all the cursed crew.</p>

<p>Then I: "Inform thee, Master! if thou may, What wretched soul is this, on whom their hands His foes have laid." My leader to his side Approach'd, and whence he came inquired; to whom Was answer'd thus: "Born in Navarre's domain,1 My mother placed me in a lord's retinue; For she had borne me to a losel vile, A spendthrift of his substance and himself. The good King Thibault3 after that I served: To peculating here my thoughts were turn'd, Whereof I give account in this dire heat."</p>

<p>Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk Issued on either side, as from a boar, Ripp'd him with one of these. 'Twixt evil claws The mouse had fallen: but Barbariccia cried, Seizing him with both arms: "Stand thou apart While I do fix him on my prong transpierced." Then added, turning to my guide his face, "Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn, Ere he again be rent." My leader thus: "Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt; Knowest thou any sprung of Latin land</p>

<p>Under the tar?" "I parted," he replied,</p>

<p>"But now from one, who sojourn'd not far thence;</p>

<p>So were I under shelter now with him,</p>

<p>Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more."</p>

<p>"Too long we suffer," Libicocco cried; Then, darting forth a prong, seized on his arm, And mangled bore away the sinewy part. Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath Would next have caught; whence angrily their chief, Turning on all sides round, with threatening brow Restrain'd them. When their strife a little ceased, Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound, My teacher thus without delay inquired: "Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap Parting, as thou hast told, thou earnest to shore?"</p>

<p>"It was the friar Gomita,"4 he rejoin'd, "He of Gallura, vessel of all guile, Who had his master's enemies in hand, And used them so that they commend him well. Money he took, and them at large dismiss'd; So he reports; and in each other charge Committed to his keeping play'd the part Of barterer to the height. With him doth herd The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.5 Sardinia is a theme whereof their tongue Is never weary. Out! alas! behold That other, how he grins. More would I say, But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore."</p>

<p>Their captain then to Farfarello turning, Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike, Rebuked him thus: "Off, cursed bird! avaunt!"</p>

<p>"If ye desire to see or hear," he thus Quaking with dread resumed, "or Tuscan spirits Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear. Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury, So that no vengeance they may fear from them,</p>

<p>And I, remaining in this self-same place, Will, for myself but one, make seven appear, When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so Our custom is to call each other up."</p>

<p>Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn'd, Then wagg'd the head and spake: "Hear his device, Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."</p>

<p>Whereto he thus, who fail'd not in rich store Of nice-wove toils: "Mischief, forsooth, extreme! Meant only to procure myself more woe."</p>

<p>No longer Alichino then refrain'd, But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake: "If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat My plumes. Quit we the vantage ground, and let The bank be as a shield; that we may see, If singly thou prevail against us all."</p>

<p>Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear.</p>

<p>They each one turn'd his eyes to the other shore, He first, who was the hardest to persuade. The spirit of Navarre chose well his time, Planted his feet on land, and at one leap Escaping, disappointed their resolve.</p>

<p>Them quick resentment stung, but him the most Who was the cause of failure: in pursuit He therefore sped, exclaiming, "Thou art caught."</p>

<p>But little it avail'd; terror outstripp'd His following flight; the other plunged beneath, And he with upward pinion raised his breast: E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives The falcon near, dives instant down, while he Enraged and spent retires. That mockery In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew After him, with desire of strife inflamed; And, for the barterer had 'scaped, so turn'd His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke In grapple close they join'd; but the other proved A goshawk able to rend well his foe; And in the boiling lake both fell. The heat Was umpire soon between them; but in vain</p>

<p>Aroument.The enraged Demons pursue Dante, but he is preserved from them by Virgil. On reaching the sixth gulf, he beholds the punishment of the hypocrites; which is, to pace coi.tinually round the gulf under the pressure of caps and hoods, that are gilt on the outside, but leaden within. He is addressed by two of these, Catalano and I^oderingo, Knights of St. Mary, otherwise called Joyous Friars of Bologna. Caiaphas is seen fixed to a cross on the ground, and lies so stretched along the way, that all tread on him in passing.</p>

<p>IN silence and in solitude we went, One first, the other following his steps, As minor friars journeying on their road. The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse Upon old /Esop's fable,1 where he told What fate unto the mouse and frog befell; For language hath not sounds more like in sense, Than are these chances, if the origin And end of each be heedfully compared. And as one thought bursts from another forth, So afterward from that another sprang, Which added doubly to my former fear. For thus I reason'd: "These through us have been So foil'd, with loss and mockery so complete, As needs must sting them sore. If anger then Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell They shall pursue us, than the savage hound Snatches the leveret panting 'twixt his jaws."</p>

<p>He answer'd: "Were I form'd of leaded glass, I should not sooner draw unto myself Thy outward image, than I now imprint That from within. This moment came thy thoughts Presented before mine, with similar act And countenance similar, so that from both I one design have framed. If the right coast Incline so much, that we may thence descend Into the other chasm, we shall escape Secure from this imagined pursuit."</p>

<p>He had not spoke his purpose to the end, When I from far beheld them with spread wings Approach to take us. Suddenly my guide Caught me, even as a mother that from sleep Is by the noise aroused, and near her sees The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him Than of herself, that but a single vest Clings round her limbs. Down from the jutting beach Supine he cast him to that pendent rock, Which closes on one part the other chasm.</p>

<p>Never ran water with such hurrying pace Adown the tube to turn a land-mill's wheel, When nearest it approaches to the spokes, As then along that edge my master ran, Carrying me in his bosom, as a child, Not a companion. Scarcely had his feet Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath, When over us the steep they reach'd: but fear In him was none; for that high Providence, Which placed them ministers of the fifth foss, Power of departing thence took from them all.</p>

<p>There in the depth we saw a painted tribe, Who paced with tardy steps around, and wept, Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.</p>

<p>Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down Before their eyes, in fashion like to those Worn by the monks in Cologne.2 Their outside Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view, But leaden all within, and of such weight, That Frederick's3 compared to these were straw. Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!</p>

<p>We yet once more with them together turn'd To leftward, on their dismal moan intent. But by the weight opprest, so slowly came The fainting people, that our company Was changed, at every movement of the step.</p>

<p>Whence I my guide address'd: "See that thou find Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known; And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."</p>

<p>Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice, Cried after us aloud: "Hold in your feet, Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air. Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."</p>

<p>Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake: "Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."</p>

<p>I staid, and saw two spirits in whose look Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd To overtake me; but the load they bare And narrow path retarded their approach.</p>

<p>Soon as arrived, they with an eye askance Perused me, but spake not: then turning, each To other thus conferring said: "This one Seems, by the action of his throat, alive; And, be they dead, what privilege allows They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"</p>

<p>Then thus to me: "Tuscan, who visitest The college of the mourning hypocrites, Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."</p>

<p>4 "Joyous friars." "Those who ruled the city of Florence on the part of the Ghibellines perceiving this discontent and murmuring, which they were fearful might produce a rebellion against themselves, in order to satisfy the people, made choice of two knights, Frati Gaudenti (joyous friars) of Bologna, on whom they conferred the chief power in Florence; one named M. Catalano de' Malavolti, the other M. Loderingo di Liandolo; one an adherent of the Guelf, the other of the Gbibclline party. It is to be remarked, that the Joyous Friars were called Knights of St. Mary, and became knights on taking that habit: their robes were white, the mantle sable, and the arms a white field and red cross with two stars: their office was to defend widows and orphans, they were to act as mediators; they had internal regulations, like other religious bodies. The above-mentioned M. Loderingo was the founder of that order. But it was not long before they too well de-</p>

<p>served the appellation given them, and were found to be more bent on enjoying themselves than on any other object. These two friars were called in by the Florentines, and had a residence assigned them in the palace belonging to the people, over against the Abbey. Such was the dependence placed on the character of their order, it was expected they would be impartial, and would save the commonwealth any unnecessary expense; instead of which, though inclined to opposite parties, they sccredy and hypocritically concurred in promoting their own advantage rather than the public good."G.

<p>"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue," One of them answer'd, "are so leaden gross, That with their weight they make the balances To crack beneath them. Joyous friars4 we were, Bologna's natives; Catalano I, He Loderingo named; and by thy land Together taken, as men used to take A single and indifferent arbiter, To reconcile their strifes. How there we sped, Gardingo's vicinage5 can best declare."</p>

<p>"O friars!" I began, "your miseries" But there brake off, for one had caught mine eye, Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground: He, when he saw me, writhed himself, throughout Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard. And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware, Thus spake: "That pierced spirit,6 whom intent Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees Counsel, that it were fitting for one man</p>

<p>To suffer for the people. He doth lie Transverse; nor any passes, but him first Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs. In straits like this along the foss are placed The father of his consort,7 and the rest Partakers in that council, seed of ill And sorrow to the Jews." I noted then, How Virgil gazed with wonder upon him, Thus abjecdy extended on the cross In banishment eternal. To the friar He next his words address'd: "We pray ye tell, If so be lawful, whether on our right Lies any opening in the rock, whereby We both may issue hence, without constraint On the dark angels, that compell'd they come To lead us from this depth." He thus replied: "Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock From the great circle moving, which o'ersteps Each vale of horror, save that here his cope Is shatter'd. By the ruin ye may mount: For on the side it slants, and most the height Rises below." With head bent down awhile My leader stood; then spake: "He warn'd us ill, Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."</p>

<p>To whom the friar: "At Bologna erst I many vices of the Devil heard; Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar, And the father of lies!'" When he had spoke, My leader with large strides proceeded on, Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.</p>

<p>IN the year's early nonage,1 when the sun Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn, And now toward equal day the nights recede; Whenas the rime upon the earth puts on Her dazzling sister's image, but not long Her milder sway endures; then riseth up The village hind, whom fails his wintry store, And looking out beholds the plain around All whiten'd; whence impatiently he smites His thighs, and to his hut returning in, There paces to and fro, wailing his lot, As a discomfited and helpless man; Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon The world hath changed its countenance, grasps his crook, And forth to pasture drives his little flock: So me my guide dishearten'd, when I saw His troubled forehead; and so speedily That ill was cured; for at the fallen bridge Arriving, toward me with a look as sweet, He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld At the steep mountain's foot. Regarding well The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm And took me up. As one, who, while he works, Computes his labor's issue, that he seems Still to foresee the effect; so lifting me Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd His eye upon another. "Grapple that," Said he, "but first make proof, if it be such As will sustain thee." For one capt with lead</p>

And if the precinct of this coast Were not less ample than the last, for him I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd. But Malebolge all toward the mouth Inclining of the nethermost abyss, The site of every valley hence requires, That one side upward slope, the other fall.</p>

<p>At length the point from whence the utmost stone Juts down, we reach'd; soon as to that arrived, So was the breath exhausted from my lungs I could no further, but did seat me there.</p>

<p>"Now needs thy best of man;" so spake my guide: "For not on downy plumes, nor under shade Of canopy reposing, fame is won; Without which whosoe'r consumes his days, Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth, As smoke in air or foam upon the wave. Thou therefore rise: vanquish thy weariness By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight Of her corporeal frame to crush her down. A longer ladder yet remains to scale. From these to have escaped sufficeth not, If well thou note me, profit by my words."</p>

<p>I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent Than I in truth did feel me. "On," I cried, "For I am stout and fearless." Up the rock Our way we held, more rugged than before, Narrower, and steeper far to climb. From talk I ceased not, as we journey'd, so to seem Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss Did issue forth, for utterance suited ill. Though on the arch that crosses there I stood, What were the words I knew not, but who spake Seem'd moved in anger. Down I stoop'd to look; But my quick eye might reach not to the depth For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake: "To the next circle, teacher, bend thy steps,</p>

<p>We from the bridge's head descended, where To the eighth mound it joins; and then, the chasm Opening to view, I saw a crowd within Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape And hideous, that remembrance in my veins Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands Let Libya vaunt no more: if Jaculus, Pareas and Chelyder be her brood, Cenchris and Amphisbsena, plagues so dire Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she show'd, Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.</p>

<p>Amid this dread exuberance of woe Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear, Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide, Or heliotrope to charm them out of view. With serpents were their hands behind them bound, Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head, Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one Near to our side, darted an adder up, And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied, Transpierced him. Far more quickly than e'er pen Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and changed To ashes all, pour'd out upon the earth. When there dissolved he lay, the dust again Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell, The Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years Have well-nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith Renascent: blade nor herb throughout his life He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone And odorous amomum: swaths of nard And myrrh his funeral shroud.

<p>Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out Such blows in stormy vengeance. Who he was, My teacher next inquired; and thus in few He answer'd: "Vanni Fucci2 am I call'd, Not long since rained down from Tuscany To this dire gullet. Me the bestial life And not the human pleased, mule that I was, Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."</p>

<p>The sinner heard and feign'd not, but toward me His mind directing and his face, wherein Was dismal shame depictured, thus he spake: "It grieves me more to have been caught by thee In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than When I was taken from the other life. I have no power permitted to deny What thou inquirest. I am doom'd thus low To dwell, for that the sacristy by me Was rifled of its goodly ornaments, And with the guilt another falsely charged.

We then brake off discourse, Intent on these alone. I knew them not: But, as it chanceth oft, befell that one Had need to name another. "Where," said he, "Doth Cianfa4 lurk?"

If, O reader! now Thou be not apt to credit what I tell, No marvel; for myself do scarce allow The witness of mine eyes. But as I look'd Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him: His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot Seized on each arm (while deep in either cheek He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd Upon the reins behind.

<p>A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,</p>

<p>And the clean white expires. The other two</p>

<p>Look'd on exclaiming, "Ah! how dost thou change,</p>

<p>Agnello!5 See! Thou art nor double now,</p>

<p>Nor only one." The two heads now became</p>

<p>One, and two figures blended in one form</p>

<p>Appear'd, where both were lost. Of the four lengths</p>

<p>Two arms were made: the belly and the chest,</p>

<p>The thighs and legs, into such members changed</p>

<p>As never eye hath seen. Of former shape</p>

<p>All trace was vanish'd. Two, yet neither, seem'd</p>

<p>Argument.Remounting by the steps, down which they have descended to the seventh gulf, they go forward to the arch that stretches over the eighth, and from thence behold numberless flames wherein are punished the evil counsellors, each flame containing a sinner, save one, in which were Diomede and Ulysses, the latter of whom relates the manner of his death.</p>

<p>FLORENCE, exult! for thou so mightily Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell. Among the plunderers, such the three I found Thy citizens; whence shame to me thy son, And no proud honour to thyself redounds.</p>

<p>But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn, Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long Shalt feel what Prato1 (not to say the rest) Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance Were in good time, if it befell thee now. Would so it were, since it must needs befall! For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.</p>

The calamities more particularly pointed at arc said to be the fall of a wooden bridge over the Arno, in May, 1304, where a large multitude</p>

<p>were assembled to witness a representation of hell and the infernal torments, in consequence of which accident many lives were lost; and a conflagration, that in the following month destroyed more than 1,700 houses. Sec G. Villani, Hist. lib. viii. c. lxx. and Ixxi.</p>

<p>As in that season, when the sun least veils His face that lightens all, what time the fly Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then, Upon some cliff reclined, beneath him sees Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale, Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labor lies; With flames so numberless throughout its space Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth Was to my view exposed. As he, whose wrongs The bears avenged, as its departure saw Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect Raised their steep flight for heaven; his eyes meanwhile, Straining pursued them, till the flame alone, Upsoaring like a misty speck, he kenn'd: E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame, A sinner so enfolded close in each, That none exhibits token of the theft.</p>

<p>Upon the bridge I forward bent to look And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fallen, Though push'd not from the height. The guide, who mark'd How I did gaze attentive, thus began: "Within these ardours are the spirits; each Swathed in confining fire." "Master! thy word," I answer'd, "hath assured me; yet I deem'd Already of the truth, already wish'd To ask thee who is in yon fire, that comes So parted at the summit, as it seem'd Ascending from that funeral pile2 where lay The Theban brothers."

<p>In repetition urged, that thou vouchsafe</p>

<p>He thus: "Thy prayer is worthy of much praise, And I accept it therefore; but do thou Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine; For I divine thy wish; and they perchance, For they were Greeks,4 might shun discourse with thee."</p>

<p>When there the flame had come, where time and place Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began: "O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire! If, living, I of you did merit aught, Whate'er the measure were of that desert, When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd, Move ye not on, till one of you unfold In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."</p>

<p>Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire That labors with the wind, then to and fro Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds, Threw out its voice, and spake: "When I escaped From Circe, who beyond a circling year Had held me near Caieta by her charms, Ere thus /Eneas yet had named the shore; Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</p>

Cervia is a small maritime city, about fifteen miles to the south of Ravenna. Guido was the son of Ostasio da Polenta, and made himself master of Ravenna in 1265. In 1322 he was deprived of his sovereignty, and died at Bologna in 1323. This last and most munificent patron of Dante is enumerated among the poets of his time.</p>

Two of them, namely, Grifolino of Arezzo, and Capocchio of Siena, are introduced speaking.</p>

<p>SO were mine eyes inebriate with the view Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds Disfigured, that they long'd to stay and weep. But Virgil roused me: "What yet gazest on? Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below Among the maim'd and miserable shades? Thou hast not shown in any chasm beside This weakness. Know, if thou wouldst number them, That two and twenty miles the valley winds Tts circuit, and already is the moon Beneath our feet: the time permitted now Is short; and more, not seen, remains to see."</p>

<p>"If thou," I straight replied, "hadst weigh'd the cause, For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excused The tarrying still." My leader part pursued His way, the while I follow'd, answering him, And adding thus: "Within that cave I deem, Whereon so fixedly I held my ken, There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood, Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear."</p>

<p>Then spake my master: "Let thy soul no more Afflict itself for him. Direct elsewhere Its thought, and leave him. At the bridge's foot I mark'd how he did point with menacing look At thee, and heard him by the others named Geri of Bello.1 Thou so wholly then Wert busied with his spirit, who once ruled The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not That way, ere he was gone."

<p>So we discoursed to where the rock first show'd The other valley, had more light been there, E'en to the lowest depth. Soon as we came O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood Were to our view exposed, then many a dart Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all With points of thrilling pity, that I closed Both ears against the volley with mine hands.</p>

<p>As were the torment, if each lazar-house Of Valdichiana,2 in the sultry time 'Twixt July and September, with the isle Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,3 Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss Together; such was here the torment: dire The stench, as issuing streams from fester'd limbs.</p>

<p>We on the utmost shore of the long rock Descended still to leftward. Then my sight Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein The minister of the most mighty Lord, All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment The forgers noted on her dread record.</p>

Step by step We journey'd on, in silence looking round, And listening those diseased, who strove in vain To lift their forms. Then two I mark'd, that sat Propt 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans Set to retain the heat. From head to foot, A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord Impatient waited, or himself perchance Tired with long watching, as of these each one Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness Of ne'er abated pruriency. The crust Came drawn from underneath, in flakes, like scales Scraped from the bream, or fish of broader mail.</p>

<p>"O thou! who with thy fingers rendest off Thy coat of proof," thus spake my guide to one, "And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them, Tell me if any born of Latian land Be among these within: so may thy nails Serve thee for everlasting to this toil."</p>

<p>"Both are of Latium," weeping he replied, "Whom tortured thus thou seest: but who art thou That hast inquired of us?" To whom my guide: "One that descend with this man, who yet lives, From rock to rock, and show him Hell's abyss."</p>

<p>Then started they asunder, and each turn'd Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear Those words redounding struck. To me my liege Address'd him: "Speak to them whate'er thou list."</p>

<p>And I therewith began: "So may no time Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men In the upper world, but after many suns Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are, And of what race ye come. Your punishment, Unseemly and disgustful in its kind, Deter you not from opening thus much to me."</p>

And when the pride Of all presuming Troy fell from its height, By fortune overwhclm'd, and the old king With his realm perish'd; then did Hecuba, A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son, Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense Did she run barking even as a dog; Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul. But ne'er the Furies, or of Thebes, or Troy, With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads Infixing in the limbs of man or beast, As now two pale and naked ghosts I saw, That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine Excluded from his stye.

<p>One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly named, With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch, That like a drum resounded: but forthwith Adamo smote him on the face, the blow Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard.</p>

<p>"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me The power to move," said he, "I have an arm At liberty for such employ." To whom Was answer'd: "When thou wentest to the fire, Thou hadst it not so ready at command; Then readier when it coin'd the impostor gold."</p>

<p>And thus the dropsied: "Ay, now speak'st thou true: But there thou gavest not such true testimony, When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy."</p>

<p>"If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin," Said Sinon; "I am here for but one fault, And thou for more than any imp beside."</p>

<p>"Remember," he replied, "O perjured one! The horse remember, that did teem with death; And all the world be witness to thy guilt."</p>

<p>"To thine," return'd the Greek, "witness the thirst Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes, A mass corrupt." To whom the coiner thus: "Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass Its evil saying. Me if thirst assails, Yet I am stuft with moisture. Thou art parch'd: Pains rack thy head: no urging wouldst thou need To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up."</p>

<p>I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide Admonish'd: "Now beware. A little more, And I do quarrel with thee." I perceived How angrily he spake, and toward him turn'd With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet Confounds me. As a man that dreams of harm Befallen him, dreaming wishes it a dream, And that which is, desires as if it were not; Such then was I, who, wanting power to speak, Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while Excused me, though unweeting that I did.</p>

"Raphel* bai ameth, sabi almi:" So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns Became not; and my guide address'd him thus: "O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage Or other passion wring thee. Search thy neck, There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on. Spirit confused! lo, on thy mighty breast Where hangs the baldrick!" Then to me he spake: "He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this, Through whose ill counsel in the world no more One tongue prevails.  But pass we on, nor waste Our words; for so each language is to him, As his to others, understood by none."</p>

<p>Then to the leftward turning sped we forth, And at a sling's throw found another shade Far fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say What master hand had girt him; but he held Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before, The other, with a chain, that fasten'd him From the neck down; and five times round his form Apparent met the wreathed links.  "This proud one Would of his strength against almighty Jove Make trial," said my guide: "whence he is thus Requited: Ephialtes him they call. Great was his prowess, when the giants brought Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he plied, Now moves he never."   Forthwith I return'd: "Fain would I, if't were possible, mine eyes, Of Briareus immeasurable, gain'd Experience next."

He in haste forth stretch'd his hands, And caught my guide.  Alcides6 whilom felt That grapple, straiten'd sore.  Soon as my guide Had felt it, he bespake me thus:   "This way, That I may clasp thee;" then so caught me up, That we were both one burden.

The Count Ugolino, to effect his purpose, united with the archbishop and his party, and having betrayed Nino, his sister's son, they contrived that he and his followers should either be driven out of Pisa, or their persons seized. Nino hearing this, and not seeing any means of defending himself, retired to Calci, his castle, and formed an alliance with the Florentines and the people of Lucca, against the Pisans. The count, before Nino was gone, in order to cover his treachery, when everything was settled for his expulsion, quitted Pisa, and repaired to a manor of his called Settimo; whence, as soon as he was informed of Nino's departure, he returned to Pisa with great rejoicing and festivity, and was elevated to the supreme power with every demonstration of triumph and honor. But his greatness was not of long continuance. It pleased the Almighty that a total reverse of fortune should ensue, as a punishment for his acts of treachery and guilt; for he was said to have poisoned the Count An-selmo da Capraia, his sister's son, on account of the envy and fear excited in his mind by the high esteem in which the gracious manners of Ansclmo were held</p>

He was immediately compelled to surrender; his bastard son and his grandson fell in the assault; and two of his sons, with their two sons also, were conveyed to prison. ... In the following March, the Pisans, who had imprisoned the Count Ugolino, with two of his sons and two of his grandchildren, the offspring of his son the Count Guclfo, in a tower on the Piazza of the Anziani, caused the tower to be locked, the key thrown into the Arno, and all food to be withheld from them. In a few days they died of hunger; but the Count first with loud cries declared his penitence, and yet neither priest nor friar was allowed to shrive him. All the five, when dead, were dragged out of the prison, and meanly interred; and from thenceforward the tower was called the Tower of Famine, and so shall ever be." G. Villani, lib. vii. between Pisa and Lucca.</p>

<p>After short course the father and the sons</p>

<p>Seem'd tired and lagging, and methought I saw</p>

<p>The sharp tusks gore their sides. When I awoke,</p>

<p>Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard</p>

<p>My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask</p>

<p>For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang</p>

<p>Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;</p>

<p>And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?</p>

<p>Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near</p>

<p>When they were wont to bring us food; the mind</p>

<p>Of each misgave him through his dream, and I</p>

<p>Heard, at its outlet underneath, lock'd up</p>

<p>The horrible tower: whence, uttering not a word,</p>

<p>I look'd upon the visage of my sons.</p>

<p>I wept not: so all stone I felt within.</p>

<p>They wept: and one, my little Anselm, cried,</p>

<p>'Thou lookest so!  Father, what ails thee?'  Yet</p>

<p>I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day</p>

<p>Nor the next night, until another sun</p>

<p>Came out upon the world. When a faint beam</p>

<p>Had to our doleful prison made its way,</p>

<p>And in four countenances I descried</p>

<p>The image of my own, on either hand</p>

<p>Through agony I bit; and they, who thought</p>

<p>I did it through desire of feeding, rose</p>

<p>O' the sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve</p>

<p>Far less if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gavest</p>

<p>These weeds of miserable flesh we wear;</p>

<p>And do thou strip them off from us again.'</p>

<p>Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down</p>

<p>My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next</p>

<p>There, very weeping suffers not to weep; For, at their eyes, grief, seeking passage, finds Impediment, and rolling inward turns For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show, Under the socket brimming all the cup.</p>

<p>Now though the cold had from my face dislodged Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd Some breath of wind I felt.  "Whence cometh this," Said I, "my Master?   Is not here below All vapor quench'd?""Thou shalt be speedily," He answer'd, "where thine eyes shall tell thee whence, The cause descrying of this airy shower."</p>

<p>Then cried out one, in the chill crust who mourn'd: "O souls! so cruel, that the farthest post Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove The harden'd veil; that I may vent the grief Impregnate at my heart, some little space,</p>

<p>And if I extricate thee not, far down As to the lowest ice may I descend."</p>

<p>"The friar Alberigo," 4 answer'd he, "Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date More luscious for my fig.""Hah!" I exclaim'd, "Art thou, too, dead?"  "How in the world aloft It fareth with my body," answer'd he, "I am right ignorant. Such privilege Hath Ptolomea,1 that oft-times the soul Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorced. And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes, Know that the soul, that moment she betrays, As I did, yields her body to a fiend Who after moves and governs it at will, Till all its time be rounded: headlong she Falls to this cistern. And perchance above Doth yet appear the body of a ghost, Who here behind me winters.  Him thou know'st, If thou but newly art arrived below. The years are many that have passed away, Since to this fastness Branca Doria6 came."</p>

<p>"Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me; For Branca Doria never yet hath died, But doth all natural functions of a man, Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."</p>

<p>*"Thc friar Alberigo." Alberigo de' Manfredi, of Faenza, one of the Frati Godenti (Joyous Friars), who having quarrelled with some of his brotherhood, under pretence of wishing to be reconciled, invited them to a banquet, at the conclusion of which he called for the fruit, a signal for the assassins to rush in and despatch those whom he had marked for destruction. Hence, adds Landino, it is said proverbially of one who has been stabbed, that he had had some of the friar Alberigo's fruit.</p>

<p>s "Ptolomea." This circle is named Ptolomca from Ptolemy the son of Abu-bus, by whom Simon and his sons were murdered, at a great banquet he had made for them. See I Maccabees, ch. xvi. Or from Ptolemy, King of Egypt, the betrayer of Pompey the Great.</p>

<p>8 "Branca Doria." The family of Doria was possessed of great influence in Genoa. Branca is said to have murdered his father-in-law, Michel Zanche. See Canto xxii.</p>

<p>He thus:  "Not yet unto that upper foss By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch Tenacious boils, had Michel Zanche reach'd, When this one left a demon in his stead In his own body, and of one his kin, Who with him treachery wrought. But now put forth Thy hand, and ope mine eyes." I oped them not. Ill manners were best courtesy to him.</p>

<p>Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way With every foulness stain'd why from the earth Are ye not cancel'd?   Such an one of yours I with Romagna's darkest spirit7 found, As, for his doings, even now in soul Is in Cocytus plunged, and yet doth seem In body still alive upon the earth.</p>

<p>Argument.In the fourth and last round of the ninth circle, those who have betrayed their benefactors are wholly covered with ice. And in the midst is Lucifer, at whose back Dante and Virgil ascend, till by a secret path they reach the surface of the other hemisphere of the earth, and once more obtain sight of the stars.</p>

<p>I AHE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth I    Toward us; therefore look," so spake my guide, g    "If thou discern him." As, when breathes a cloud Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round; Such was the fabric then methought I saw.</p>

<p>To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew Behind my guide: no covert else was there.</p>

<p>Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain Record the marvel) where the souls were all Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass Pellucid the frail stem.  Some prone were laid; Others stood upright, this upon the soles, That on his head, a third with face to feet Arch'd like a bow.  When to the point we came, Whereat my guide was pleased that I should see 7 The friar Alberigo.</p>

<p>canto xxxiv HELL I4I</p>

<p>The creature eminent in beauty once,</p>

<p>He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.</p>

<p>"Lo!" he exclaim'd, "lo! Dis; and lo! the place, Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."</p>

<p>How frozen and how faint I then became, Ask me not, reader! for I write it not; Since words would fail to tell thee of my state. I was not dead nor living.   Think thyself, If quick conception work in thee at all, How I did feel.  That emperor, who sways The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from the ice Stood forth; and I in stature am more like A giant, than the giants are his arms. Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits With such a part.  If he were beautiful As he is hideous now, and yet did dare To scowl upon his Maker, well from him May all our misery flow. Oh what a sight! How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy Upon his head three faces: one in front Of hue vermilion, the other two with this Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest; The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd; the left To look on, such as come from whence old Nile Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth Two mighty wings, enormous as became A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw Outstretch'd on the wide sea. No plumes had they, But were in texture like a bat; and these He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth Was frozen.  At six eyes he wept: the tears Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam. At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd, Bruised as with ponderous engine; so that three Were in this guise tormented.  But far more Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd By the fierce rending, whence oft-times the back Was stript of all its skin.  "That upper spirit, Who hath worst punishment," so spake my guide,</p>

<p>142</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xxxiv</p>

<p>"Is Judas, he that hath his head within And plies the feet without. Of th' other two, Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw Who hangs, is Brutus:' lo! how he doth writhe And speaks not.  The other, Cassius, that appears So large of limb.  But night now reascends; And it is time for parting. All is seen."</p>

<p>I clipp'd him round the neck; for so he bade: And noting time and place, he, when the wings Enough were oped, caught fast the shaggy sides, And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.</p>

<p>Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh Upon the swelling of the haunches turns, My leader there, with pain and struggling hard, Turn'd round his head where his feet stood before, And grappled at the fell as one who mounts; That into Hell methought we turn'd again.</p>

<p>"Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake The teacher, panting like a man forespent, "We must depart from evil so extreme:" Then at a rocky opening issued forth, And placed me on the brink to sit, next join'd With wary step my side.  I raised mine eyes, Believing that I Lucifer should see Where he was lately left, but saw him now With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort, Who see not what the point was I had past, Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.</p>

<p>"Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet. The way is long, and much uncouth the road; And now within one hour and a half of noon* The sun returns."  It was no palace-hall</p>

<p>1 "Brutus." Landino struggles to extricate Brutus from the unworthy lot which is here assigned him. He maintains that by Brutus and Cassius are not meant the individuals known by those names, but any who put a lawful monarch to death. Yet if Carsar was such, the conspirators might be regarded as deserving of their doom.   If Dante, however, believed Bru-</p>

<p>tus to have been actuated by evil motives in putting Cxsar to death, the excellence of the patriot's character in other respects would only have aggravated his guilt in that particular.</p>

<p>CANTO I</p>

<p>Argument.The Poet describes the delight he experienced at issuing a little before dawn from the infernal regions, into the pure air that surrounds the isle of Purgatory; and then relates how, turning to the right, he beheld four stars never seen before, but by our first parents, and met on his left the shade of Cato of Utica, who, having warned him and Virgil what is needful to be done before they proceed on their way through Purgatory, disappears; and the two poets go toward the shore, where Virgil cleanses Dante's face with the dew, and girds him with a reed, as Cato had commanded.</p>

<p>Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread O'er the serene aspect of the pure air, High up as the first circle,2 to mine eyes Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scaped Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom, That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.

<p>To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind On the other pole attentive, where I saw Four stars5 ne'er seen before save by the ken Of our first parents."  Heaven of their rays Seem'd joyous.  O thou northern site! bereft Indeed, and widow'd, since of these deprived.</p>

<p>As from this view I had desisted, straight Turning a litde toward the other pole, There from whence now the wain7 had disappear'd, I saw an old man8 standing by my side Alone, so worthy of reverence in his look, That ne'er from son to father more was owed. Low down his beard, and mix'd with hoary white, Descended, like his locks, which, parting, fell Upon his breast in double fold.  The beams Of those four luminaries on his face So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.</p>

<p>"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream, Forth from the eternal prison-house have fled?" He spoke and moved those venerable plumes. "Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure Lights you emerging from the depth of night, That makes the infernal valley ever black? Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss Broken, or in high Heaven new laws ordain'd, That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?"</p>

<p>My guide, then laying hold on me, by words And intimations given with hand and head, Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay Due reverence; then thus to him replied:</p>

<p>"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven' Descending, him besought me in my charge To bring.  But since thy will implies, that more Our true condition I unfold at large, Mine is not to deny thee thy request.</p>

For not with eye, by any cloud obscured, Would it be seemly before him to come, Who stands the foremost minister in Heaven. This islet all around, there far beneath, Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed Produces store of reeds.  No other plant, Cover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk, There lives, not bending to the water's sway. After, this way return not; but the sun Will show you, that now rises, where to take The mountain in its easiest ascent."</p>

<p>He disappear'd; and I myself upraised Speechless, and to my guide retiring close, Toward him turn'd mine eyes.  He thus began: "My son! observant thou my steps pursue. We must retreat to rereward; for that way The champain to its low extreme declines."</p>

<p>The dawn had chased the matin hour of prime, Which fled before it, so that from afar I spied the trembling of the ocean stream.</p>

<p>We traversed the deserted plain, as one Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step Trodden in vain till he regain the path.</p>

<p>When we had come, where yet the tender dew Strove with the sun, and in a place where fresh The wind breathed o'er it, while it slowly dried; Both hands extended on the watery grass My master placed, in graceful act and kind. Whence I of his intent before apprised, Stretch'd out to him my cheeks suffused with tears. There to my visace he anew restored That hue which the dun shades of Hell conceal'd.</p>

<p>CANTO II</p>

<p>Argument.They behold a vessel under conduct of an angel, coming over the waves with spirits to Purgatory, among whom, when the passengers have landed, Dante recognizes his friend Casella; but, while they are entertained by him with a song, they hear Cato exclaiming against their negligent loitering, and at that rebuke hasten forward to the mountain.</p>

<p>NOW had the sun' to that horizon reach'd, That covers, with the most exalted point Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls; And night, that opposite to him her orb Rounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth, Holding the scales,2 that from her hands are dropt When she reigns highest:3 so that where I was, Aurora's white and vermeil-tinctured cheek To orange turn'd as she in age increased.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink, Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought Journey, while motionless the body rests. When lo! as, near upon the hour of dawn, Through the thick vapors Mars with fiery beam Glares down in west, over the ocean floor; So seem'd, what once again I hope to view, A light, so swiftly coming through the sea, No winged course might equal its career. From which when for a space I had withdrawn Mine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide, Again I look'd, and saw it grown in size And brightness: then on either side appear'd Something, but what I knew not, of bright hue,</p>

<p>3 "When she reigns highest" is (according to Venturi, whom I have followed) "when the autumnal equinox is passed." Lombardi supposes it to mean "when the nights begin to increase, that is, after the summer solstice."</p>

<p>And by degrees from underneath it came</p>

<p>Another.   My preceptor silent yet</p>

<p>Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,</p>

<p>Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew</p>

<p>The pilot, cried aloud, "Down, down; bend low</p>

<p>Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:</p>

<p>Now shalt thou see true ministers indeed.</p>

<p>Lo! how all human means he sets at naught;</p>

<p>So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail</p>

<p>Except his wings, between such distant shores.</p>

<p>Lo! how straight up to Heaven he holds them rear'd,</p>

<p>Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,</p>

<p>That not like mortal hairs fall off or change."</p>

<p>As more and more toward us came, more bright Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down. He drove ashore in a small bark so swift And light, that in its course no wave it drank. The heavenly steersman at the prow was seen, Visibly written Blessed in his looks. Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.</p>

<p>"In Exitu* Israel de Egypto," All with one voice together sang, with what In the remainder of that hymn is writ. Then soon as with the sign of holy cross He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land: He, swifdy as he came, return'd.

<p>PURGATORY</p>

<p>The ascent will seem to us as play."  The spirits, Who from my breathing had perceived I lived, Grew pale with wonder.  As the multitude Flock round a herald sent with olive branch, To hear what news he brings, and in their haste Tread one another down; e'en so at sight Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one Forgetful of its errand to depart Where, cleansed from sin, it might be made all fair.</p>

<p>Then one I saw darting before the rest With such fond ardour to embrace me, I To do the like was moved. O shadows vain! Except in outward semblance: thrice my hands I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd Empty into my breast again.  Surprise I need must think was painted in my looks, For that the shadow smiled and backward drew. To follow it I hasten'd, but with voice Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist. Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it, To talk with me it would a little pause. It answer'd:   "Thee as in my mortal frame I loved, so loosed from it I love thee still, And therefore pause: but why walkest thou here?"</p>

<p>"Not without purpose once more to return, Thou find'st me, my Casella,5 where I am, Journeying this way;" I said: "but how of thee Hath so much time been lost?" He answer'd straight:</p>

<p>"Love, that discourses in my thoughts," he then Began in such soft accents, that within The sweetness thrills me yet.   My gentle guide, And all who came with him, so well were pleased, That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.</p>

<p>Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes We stood, when lo! that old man venerable Exclaiming, "How is this, ye tardy spirits? What negligence detains you loitering here? Run to the mountain to cast off those scales, That from your eyes the sight of God conceal."</p>

<p>As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food Collected, blade or tares, without their pride Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort, If aught alarm them, suddenly desert Their meal, assail'd by more important care; So I that new-come troop beheld, the song Deserting, hasten to the mountain's side, As one who goes, yet, where he tends, knows not.</p>

<p>CANTO III</p>

<p>Argument.Our Poet, perceiving no shadow except that cast by his own body, is fearful that Virgil has deserted him; but he is freed from that error, and both arrive together at the foot of the mountain; on finding it too steep to climb, they inquire the way from a troop of spirits that are coming toward them, and are by them shown which is the easiest ascent. Manfredi, King of Naples, who is one of these spirits, bids Dante inform his daughter Costanza, Queen of Arragon, of the manner in which he had died.</p>

<p>THEM sudden flight had scatter'd o'er the plain, Turn'd toward the mountain, whither reason's voice</p>

<p>Drives us: I, to my faithful company</p>

<p>Adhering, left it not.   For how, of him</p>

<p>Deprived, might I have sped? or who, beside,</p>

<p>Would o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps?</p>

<p>He, with the bitter pang of self-remorse,</p>

<p>Seem'd smitten.  O clear conscience, and upright!</p>

<p>How doth a little failing wound thee sore.</p>

<p>Soon as his feet desisted (slackening pace) From haste, that mars all decency of act, My mind, that in itself before was wrapt, Its thought expanded, as with joy restored; And full against the steep ascent I set My face, where highest to Heaven its top o'erflows.</p>

<p>The sun, that flared behind, with ruddy beam Before my form was broken; for in me His rays resistance met.   I turn'd aside With fear of being left, when I beheld Only before myself the ground obscured. When thus my solace, turning him around, Bespake me kindly:  "Why distrustest thou? Believest not I am with thee, thy sure guide? It now is evening there, where buried lies The body in which I cast a shade, removed To Naples' from Brundusium's wall.   Nor thou Marvel, if before me no shadow fall, More than that in the skyey element One ray obstructs not other.  To endure Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames</p>

<p>1 "To Naples." Virgil died at Brundusium, from whence his body is said to have been removed to Naples.</p>

<p>154 THE DIVINE COMEDY canto in</p>

<p>That virtue hath disposed, which, how it works, Wills not to us should be reveal'd.  Insane, Who hopes our reason may that space explore, Which holds three persons in one substance knit. Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;</p>

<p>Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been For Mary to bring forth.  Moreover, ye Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly; To whose desires, repose would have been given, That now but serve them for eternal grief. I speak of Plato, and the Stagirite, And others many more."  And then he bent Downward his forehead, and in troubled mood Broke off his speech. Meanwhile we had arrived Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps To climb it had been vain. The most remote, Most wild, untrodden path, in all the tract Twixt Lerice and Turbia,2 were to this A ladder easy and open of access.</p>

<p>"Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?** My master said, and paused; "so that he may Ascend, who journeys without aid of wing?" And while, with looks directed to the ground, The meaning of the pathway he explored, And I gazed upward round the stony height; On the left hand appear'd to us a troop Of spirits, that toward us moved their steps; Yet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd.</p>

<p>I thus my guide address'd:  "Upraise thine eyes: Lo! that way some, of whom thou mayst obtain Counsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not."</p>

<p>Straightway he look'd, and with free speech replied; "Let us tend thither: they but softly come. And thou be firm in hope, my son beloved."</p>

<p>Now was that crowd from us distant as far, (When we some thousand steps, I say, had past,) As at a throw the nervous arm could fling;</p>

<p>When all drew backward on the massy crags Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmoved, As one, who walks in doubt, might stand to look.</p>

<p>"O spirits perfect!  O already chosenl" Virgil to them began: "by that blest peace, Which, as I deem, is for you all prepared, Instruct us where the mountain low declines, So that attempt to mount it be not vain. For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves."</p>

<p>As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one, Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose To ground, and what the foremost does, that do The others, gathering round her if she stops, Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern; So saw I moving to advance the first, Who of that fortunate crew were at the head, Of modest mien, and graceful in their gait. When they before me had beheld the light From my right side fall broken on the ground, So that the shadow reach'd the cave; they stopp'd, And somewhat back retired: the same did all Who follow'd, though unweeting of the cause.</p>

<p>"Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess, This is a human body which ye see. That the sun's light is broken on the ground, Marvel not: but believe, that not without Virtue derived from Heaven, we to climb Over this wall aspire."  So them bespake My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd: "Turn, and before you there the entrance lies;" Making a signal to us with bent hands.</p>

<p>Then of them one began.  "Whoe'er thou art, Who journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn; Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen."</p>

<p>I toward him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld. Comely and fair, and gende of aspect He seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd.</p>

<p>When humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld Him ever:  "Now behold!" he said, and show'd</p>

But he was luxurious and ambitious, void of religion, and in his philosophy an Epicurean. He fell in the battle with Charles of Anjou in 1265, alluded to in Canto xxviii of Hell, vcr. 13, or rather in that of Benevento. The successes of Charles were so rapidly followed up, that our author, exact as he generally is, might not have thought it necessary to distinguish them in point of time. "Dying excommunicated, King Charles did not allow of his being buried in sacred ground, but he was interred near the bridge of Benevento; and on his grave there was cast a stone by every one of the army, whence there was formed a great mound of stones. But some have</p>

<p>CANTO IV</p>

<p>Argument.Dante and Virgil ascend the mountain of Purgatory, by a steep and narrow path pent in on each side by rock, till they reach a part of it that opens into a ledge or cornice. There seating themselves, and turning to the east, Dante wonders at seeing the sun on their left, the cause of which is explained to him by Virgil; and while they continue their discourse, a voice addresses them, at which they turn, and find several spirits behind the rock, and among the rest one named Belacqua, who had been known to our Poet on earth, and who tells that he is doomed to linger there on account of his having delayed his repentance to the last.</p>

<p>WHEN by sensations of delight or pain, That any of our faculties hath seized, Entire the soul collects herself, it seems She is intent upon that power alone; And thus the error is disproved, which holds The soul not singly lighted in the breast. And therefore whenas aught is heard or seen, That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn'd, Time passes, and a man perceives it not. For that, whereby we hearken, is one power; Another that, which the whole spirit hath: This is as it were bound, while that is free.</p>

<p>This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit And wondering; for full fifty steps1 aloft The sun had measured, unobserved of me, When we arrived where all with one accord The spirits shouted, "Here is what ye ask."</p>

<p>We through the broken rock ascended, close Pent on each side, while underneath the ground Ask'd help of hands and feet. When we arrived Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank, Where the plain level open'd, I exclaim'd, "O Master! say, which way can we proceed."</p>

<p>He answer'd, "Let no step of thine recede. Behind me gain the mountain, till to us Some practised guide appear." That eminence Was lofty, that no eye might reach its point; And the side proudly rising, more than line From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn. I, wearied, thus began:   "Parent beloved! Turn and behold how I remain alone, If thou stay not.""My son!" he straight replied, "Thus far put forth thy strength;" and to a track Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round Circles the hill.

How that may be, if thou wouldst think; within Pondering, imagine Sion with this mount Placed on the earth, so that to both be one Horizon, and two hemispheres apart, Where lies the path7 that Phaeton ill knew To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see8 How of necessity by this, on one, He passes, while by that on the other side; If with clear view thine intellect attend."</p>

I exclaim'd, "so clear Aught saw I never, as I now discern, Where seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb9 Of the supernal motion (which in terms Of art is call'd the Equator, and remains Still 'twixt the sun and winter) for the cause Thou hast assign'd, from hence toward the north Departs, when those, who in the Hebrew land Were dwellers, saw it towards the warmer part.

<p>"As the constellation of the Gemini is nearer the Bears than Aries is, it is certain that if the sun, instead of being in Aries, had been in Gemini, both the sun and that portion of the Zodiac made 'ruddy' by the sun, would have been seen to 'wheel nearer to the Bears.'

There hope to rest thee from thy toil. No more I answer, and thus far from certain know." As he his words had spoken, near to us A voice there sounded:   "Yet ye first perchance May to repose you by constraint be led." At sound thereof each turn'd; and on the left A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I Nor he before was ware. Thither we drew; And there were some, who in the shady place Behind the rock were standing, as a man Through idleness might stand.  Among them one, Who seem'd to be much wearied, sat him down, And with his arms did fold his knees about, Holding his face between them downward bent.</p>

<p>"Sweet Sir!" I cried, "behold that man who shows Himself more idle than if laziness Were sister to him." Straight he turn'd to us, And, o'er the thigh lifting his face, observed, Then in these accents spake:  "Up then, proceed, Thou valiant one."   Straight who it was I knew; Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath Still somewhat urged me) hinder my approach. And when I came to him, he scarce his head Uplifted, saying, "Well hast thou discern'd, How from the left the sun his chariot leads?"</p>

<p>CANTO VI</p>

<p>Argument.Many besides, who arc in like case with those spoken of in the last Canto, beseech our Poet to obtain for them the prayers of their friends, when he shall be returned to this world. This moves him to express a doubt to his guide, how the dead can be profited by the prayers of the living; for the solution of which doubt he is referred to Beatrice. Afterward he meets with Sordello the Mantuan. whose affection, shown to Virgil his countryman, leads Dante to break forth into an invective against the unnatural divisions with which Italy, and more especially Florence, was distracted.</p>

<p>WHEN from their game of dice men separate, He who hath lost remains in sadness fix'd, Revolving in his mind what luckless throws He cast: but, meanwhile, all the company Go with the other; one before him runs, And one behind his mantle twitches, one Fast by his side bids him remember him. He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside; And thus1 he from the press defends himself. E'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;</p>

<p>Here of Arezzo him1 I saw, who fell By Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,3 Who in his chase was swallow'd by the stream. Here Frederic Novello,4 with his hand Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,* Who put the good Marzucco to such proof Of constancy.  Count Orso" I beheld; And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite And envy, as it said, but for no crime; I speak of Peter de la Brosse:7 and here, While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant, Let her beware; lest for so false a deed She herd with worse than these.  When I was freed From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers To hasten on their state of blessedness; Straight I began:   "O thou, my luminary! It seems expressly in thy text denied, That Heaven's supreme decree can ever bend To supplication; yet with this design Do these entreat.  Can then their hope be vain?</p>

<p>* Benincasa of Arezzo, eminent for his skill in jurisprudence, who having condemned to death Turrino da Turrita, brother of Ghino di Tacco, for his robberies in Maremma, was murdered by Ghino, in an apartment of his own house, in the presence of many witnesses. Ghino was not only suffered to escape in safety, but obtained so high a reputation by the liberality with which he dispensed the fruits of his plunder, and treated those who fell into his hands with so much courtesy, that he was afterward invited to Rome, and knighted by Boniface VIII.</p>

<p>courtiers envying the high place which he held in the King's favor, prevailed on Mary of Brabant to charge him falsely with an attempt upon her person; for which supposed crime he suffered death. So say the Italian commentators. Hcnault represents the matter very differently: "Pierre de la Brosse, formerly barber to St. Louis, afterward the favorite of Philip, fearing the too great attachment of the King for his wife Mary, accuses this princess of having poisoned Louis, eldest son of Philip, by his first marriage. This calumny is discovered by a nun of Nivelle, in Flanders. La Brosse is hanged."</p>

<p>He thus to me:  "Both what I write is plain, And these deceived not in their hope; if well Thy mind consider, that the sacred height Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame In a short moment all fulfills, which he, Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy. Besides, when I this point concluded thus, By praying no defect could be supplied; Because the prayer had none access to God. Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not Contented, unless she assure thee so, Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light: I know not if thou take me right; I mean Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above, Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."</p>

<p>Then I:  "Sir! let us mend our speed; for now I tire not as before: and lo! the hill* Stretches its shadow far."   He answer'd thus: "Our progress with this day shall be as much As we may now despatch; but otherwise Than thou supposest is the truth. For there Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold Him back returning, who behind the steep Is now so hidden, that, as erst, his beam Thou dost not break. But lo! a spirit there Stands solitary, and toward us looks: It will instruct us in the speediest way."</p>

<p>We soon approach'd it.  O thou Lombard spirit! How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood, Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes. It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass, Eying us as a lion on his watch. But Virgil, with entreaty mild, advanced, Requesting it to show the best ascent. It answer to his question none return'd; But of our country and our kind of life Demanded.  When my courteous guide began, "Mantua," the shadow, in itself absorb'd, * "The hill."

<p>Ah, slavish Italy! thou inn of grief! Vessel without a pilot in loud storm! Lady no longer of fair provinces, But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit, Even from the pleasant sound of his dear land Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen With such glad cheer: while now thy living ones In thee abide not without war; and one Malicious gnaws another; ay, of those Whom the same wall and the same moat contains.

<p>CANTO VII</p>

<p>Argument.The approach of night hindering further ascent, Sordello conducts our Poet apart to an eminence, from whence they behold a pleasant recess, in form of a flowery valley, scooped out of the mountain; where are many famous spirits, and among them the Emperor Rodolph, Ottocar, King of Bohemia, Philip III of France, Henry of Navarre, Peter III of Arragon, Charles I of Naples, Henry III of England, and William, Marquis of Montferrat.</p>

<p>A FTER their courteous greetings joyfully / \   Seven times exchanged, Sordello backward drew J   % Exclaiming, "Who are ye?""Before this mount By spirits worthy of ascent to God Was sought, my bones had by Octavius' care Been buried. I am Virgil; for no sin Deprived of Heaven, except for lack of faith." So answer'd him in few my gende guide.</p>

<p>As one, who aught before him suddenly Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries, "It is, yet is not," wavering in belief; Such he appear'd; then downward bent his eyes, And, drawing near with reverential step, Caught him, where one of mean estate might clasp His lord. "Glory of Lauum!" he exclaim'd, "In whom our tongue its utmost power display'd; Boast of my honor'd birth-place! what desert Of mine, what favour, rather, undeserved, Shows thee to me? If I to hear that voice Am worthy, say if from below thou comest,</p>

<p>Of that sad region," he replied, "thus far</p>

<p>Am I arrived, by heavenly influence led:</p>

<p>And with such aid I come. Not for my doing,</p>

<p>But for not doing, have I lost the sight</p>

<p>Of that high Sun, whom thou desirest, and who</p>

<p>By me too late was known. There is a place1</p>

<p>But by dun shades alone; where mourning's voice</p>

<p>Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs.</p>

<p>Follow'd them all. But, if thou know'st, and canst,</p>

<p>Direct us how we soonest may arrive,</p>

<p>Where Purgatory its true beginning takes."</p>

<p>He answer'd thus: "We have no certain place Assign'd us: upward I may go, or round. Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide. But thou beholdest now how day declines; And upward to proceed by night, our power Excels: therefore it may be well to choose A place of pleasant sojourn. To the right Some spirits sit apart retired. If thou Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps: And thou wilt know them, not without delight."</p>

<p>"How chances this?" was answer'd: "whoso wish'd To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd By other, or through his own weakness fail?"</p>

<p>The good Sordello then, along the ground Trailing his finger, spoke: "Only this line Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun Hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes Thy going upward, save the shades of night. These, with the want of power, perplex the will.</p>

<p>My master straight, as wondering at his speech, Exclaim'd: "Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight."</p>

<p>A little space we were removed from thence, When I perceived the mountain hollow'd out, Even as large valleys hollow'd out on earth.</p>

<p>"That way," the escorting spirit cried, "we go, Where in a bosom the high bank recedes: And thou await renewal of the day."</p>

<p>Betwixt the steep and plain, a crooked path Led us traverse into the ridge's side, Where more than half the sloping edge expires.

Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues, But of the sweetness of a thousand smells A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.</p>

<p>"Salve Regina,"4 on the grass and flowers, Here chanting, I beheld those spirits sit, Who not beyond the valley could be seen.</p>

<p>"Before the westering sun sink to his bed," Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd, " 'Mid those, desire not that I lead ye on. For from this eminence ye shall discern Better the acts and visages of all, Than, in the nether vale, among them mix'd. He, who sits high above the rest, and seems To have neglected that he should have done, And to the others' song moves not his lip, The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died, "Salve Regina."

Either (as the old commentators suppose) Alonzo III, King of Arragon, the eldest son of Peter III, who died in 1291, at the age of 27; or, according to Venturi, Peter, the youngest son.

By Beatrix and Margaret are probably meant two of the daughters of Raymond Bercnger, Count of Provence; the latter married to St. Louis of France, the former to his brother Charles of Anjou, King of Naples. See Paradise, Canto vi. 135. Dante therefore considers Peter as the most illustrious of the three monarchs.</p>

<p>" "William, that brave Marquis." William, Marquis of Montferrat, was treacherously seized by his own subjects, at Alessandria in Lombardy, A. D. 1290, and ended his life in prison. A war ensued between the people of Alessandria and those of Montferrat and the Canavese, now part of Piedmont.</p>

Lastly, Conrad Malaspina predicts to our Poet his future banishment.</p>

<p>NOW was the hour that wakens fond desire In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell, And pilgrim newly on his road with love Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far, That seems to mourn for the expiring day: When I, no longer taking heed to hear, Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark One risen from its seat, which with its hand Audience implored.

<p>Tell my Giovanna,4 that for me she call</p>

<p>There, where reply to innocence is made.</p>

<p>Her mother,5 I believe, loves me no more;</p>

<p>Since she has changed the white and wimpled folds*</p>

<p>Which she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.</p>

<p>By her it easily may be perceived,</p>

<p>How long in woman lasts the flame of love,</p>

<p>If sight and touch do not relume it oft.</p>

<p>For her so fair a burial will not make</p>

<p>The viper,7 which calls Milan to the field,</p>

<p>As had been made by shrill Gallura's bird." 8</p>

<p>He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp Of that right zeal, which with due temperature Glows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes Meanwhile to Heaven had travel'd, even there Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel Nearest the axle; when my guide inquired: "What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?"</p>

<p>I answer'd: "The three torches,9 with which here The pole is all on fire." He then to me: "The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn, Are there beneath; and these, risen in their stead."</p>

<p>While yet he spoke, Sordello to himself Drew him, and cried: "Lo there our enemy!" And with his hand pointed that way to look.</p>

<p>Along the side, where barrier none arose Around the litde vale, a serpent lay, Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food. Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;</p>

<p>And, as a beast that smooths its polish'd coat, Licking his back. I saw not, nor can tell, How those celestial falcons from their seat Moved, but in motion each one well descried. Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes, The serpent fled; and, to their stations, back The Angels up return'd with equal flight.</p>

<p>The spirit, (who to Nino, when he call'd, Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken, Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.</p>

<p>"So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high, Find, in thy free resolve, of wax so much, As may suffice thee to the enamel'd height." It thus began: "If any certain news Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there. They call'd me Conrad Malaspina; not That old one, but from him I sprang. The love I bore my people is now here refined."</p>

<p>"In your domains," I answer'd, "ne'er was I.</p>

<p>But, through all Europe, where do those men dwell,</p>

<p>To whom their glory is not manifest?</p>

<p>CANTO IX</p>

<p>Argument.Dante is carried up the mountain, asleep and dreaming, by Lucia; and, on awakening, finds himself, two hours after sunrise, with Virgil, near the gate of Purgatory, through which they are admitted by the Angel deputed by St. Peter to keep it.</p>

<p>NOW the fair consort of Tithonus old, Arisen from her mate's beloved arms, Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff; her brow, Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign Of that chill animal,1 who with his train Smites fearful nations: and where then we were, Two steps of her ascent the night had past; And now the third was closing up its wing,2 When I, who had so much of Adam with me, Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep, There where all five3 were seated. In that hour, When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay, Remembering haply ancient grief,4 renews; And when our minds, more wanderers from the flesh, And less by thought restrain'd, are, as't were, full Of holy divination in their dreams; Then, in a vision, did I seem to view A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky, With open wings, and hovering for descent; And I was in that place, methought, from whence Young Ganymede, from his associates 'reft, Was snatch'd aloft to the high consistory. "Perhaps," thought I within me, "here alone He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains</p>

<p>1 "Of that chill animal." The scorpion.</p>

<p>2 "The third was closing up its wing." The night being divided into four watches, I think he may mean that the third was past, and the fourth and last was begun, so that there might be some faint glimmering of morning twilight; and not merely, as Lombardi supposes, that the third watch was drawing toward its close,</p>

<p>which would still leave an insurmountable difficulty in the first verse.</p>

<p>3 "All five." Virgil, Dante, Sordello, Nino, and Corrado Malaspina.</p>

<p>4 "Remembering haply ancient grief." Progne having been changed into a swallow after the outrage done her by Tereus.</p>

<p>To pounce upon the prey." Therewith, it seem'd, A litde wheeling in his aery tour, Terrible as the lightning, rush'd he down, And snatch'd me upward even to the lire. There both, I thought, the eagle and myself Did burn; and so intense the imagined flames, That needs my sleep was broken off. As erst Achilles shook himself, and round him roll'd His waken'd eyeballs, wondering where he was, Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms; There whence the Greeks did after sunder him; E'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face The slumber parted, turning deadly pale, Like one ice-struck with dread. Sole at my side My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now More than two hours aloft: and to the sea My looks were turn'd. "Fear not," my master cried, "Assured we are at happy point. Thy strength Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff That circling bounds it. Lo! the entrance there, Where it doth seem disparted. Ere the dawn Usher'd the day-light, when thy wearied soul Slept in thee, o'er the flowery vale beneath A lady came, and thus bespake me: 'I Am Lucia.5 Suffer me to take this man, Who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed.' Sordello and the other gentle shapes Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone, This summit reach'd: and I pursued her steps. Here did she place thee. First, her lovely eyes That open entrance show'd me; then at once She vanish'd with thy sleep." Like one, whose doubts Are chased by certainty, and terror turn'd To comfort on discovery of the truth, Such was the change in me: and as my guide Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff He moved, and I behind him, toward the height. '"Lucia." See Hell, c. ii 97 and Paradise, c. xxxii. 123.</p>

<p>PURGATORY</p>

<p>181</p>

<p>Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise; Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully I prop the structure. Nearer now we drew, Arrived whence, in that part, where first a breach As of a wall appear'd, I could descry A portal, and three steps beneath, that led For inlet there, of different colour each; And one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word. As more and more mine eye did stretch its view, I mark'd him seated on the highest step, In visage such, as past my power to bear. Grasp'd in his hand, a naked sword glanced back The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain My sight directed. "Speak, from whence ye stand;" He cried: "What would ye? Where is your escort? Take heed your coming upward harm ye not."</p>

<p>"A heavenly dame, not skill-less of these things," Replied the instructor, "told us, even now, 'Pass that way: here the gate is.'""And may she, Befriending, prosper your ascent," resumed The courteous keeper of the gate: "Come then Before our steps." We straightway thither came.</p>

<p>The lowest stair6 was marble white, so smooth And polish'd, that therein my mirror'd form Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block, Crack'd lengthwise and across. The third, that lay Massy above, seem'd porphyry, that flamed Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein. On this God's angel either foot sustain'd, Upon the threshold seated, which appear'd A rock of diamond. Up the trinal steps My leader cheerly drew me. "Ask," said he, "With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt."</p>

<p>Piously at his holy feet devolved I cast me, praying him for pity's sake That he would open to me; but first fell</p>

<p>The white step suggests the con- contrition on their account; the porphyry, science of the penitent reflecting his of- the fervor with which he resolves on the fences; the burnt and cracked one, his   future pursuit of piety and virtue.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto ix</p>

<p>Thrice on my bosom prostrate. Seven times7</p>

<p>The letter, that denotes the inward stain,</p>

<p>He, on my forehead, with the blunted point</p>

<p>Of his drawn sword, inscribed. And "Look," he cried,</p>

<p>"When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away."</p>

<p>Ashes, or earth ta'en dry out of the ground, Were of one colour with the robe he wore. From underneath that vestment forth he drew Two keys," of metal twain: the one was gold, Its fellow silver. With the pallid first, And next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate, As to content me well. "Whenever one Faileth of these, that in the key-hole straight It turn not, to this alley then expect Access in vain." Such were the words he spake. "One is more precious:9 but the other needs Skill and sagacity, large share of each, Ere its good task to disengage the knot Be worthily perform'd. From Peter these I hold, of him instructed that I err Rather in opening, than in keeping fast; So but the suppliant at my feet implore."</p>

<p>Then of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door, Exclaiming, "Enter, but this warning hear: He forth again departs who looks behind."</p>

<p>As in the hinges of that sacred ward The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong, Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily Roar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss To leanness doom'd. Attentively I turn'd, Listening the thunder that first issued forth; And "We praise thee, O God," methought I heard,</p>

<p>7 "Seven times." Seven P's, to denote the seven sins (Peccata) of which he was to be cleansed in his passage through Purgatory.</p>

<p>* "Two keys." Lombardi remarks that painters have usually drawn St. Peter with two keys, the one of gold and the other of silver; but that Niccolo Ale-manni, in his Dissertation de Parietinis</p>

<p>Lateranensibus, produces instances of his being represented with one key, and with three. We have here, however, not St. Peter, but an angel deputed by him.</p>

<p>'The golden key denotes the divine authority by which the priest absolves the sinners; the silver, the learning and judgment requisite for the due discharge of that office.</p>

<p>canto x PURGATORY</p>

<p>In accents blended with sweet melody. The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound Of choral voices, that in solemn chant With organ10 mingle, and now high and clear Come swelling, now float indistinct away.</p>

<p>CANTO X</p>

<p>Argument.Being admitted at the gate of Purgatory, our Poets ascend a winding path up the rock, till they reach an open and level space that extends each way round the mountain. On the side that rises, and which is of white marble, are seen artfully engraven many stories of humility, which whilst they are contemplating, there approach the souls of those who expiate the sin of pride, and who are bent down beneath the weight of heavy stones.</p>

<p>WHEN we had passed the threshold of the gate, (Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse, Making the crooked seem the straighter path,) I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn'd, For that offence what plea might have avail'd?</p>

<p>We mounted up the riven rock, that wound On either side alternate, as the wave Flies and advances. "Here some litde art Behoves us," said my leader, "that our steps Observe the varying flexure of the path."</p>

<p>Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb The moon once more o'erhangs her watery couch, Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free, We came, and open, where the mount above One solid mass retires; I spent with toil, And both uncertain of the way, we stood, Upon a plain more lonesome than the roads That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink Borders upon vacuity, to foot Of the steep bank that rises still, the space Had measured thrice the stature of a man: And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight, To leftward now and now to right despatch'd, That cornice equal in extent appear'd.</p>

<p>10 "Organ." Organs were used in Italy the Emperor Julian's writings, which as early as in the sixth century. If I shows that the organ was not unknown remember rightly there is a passage in    in his time.</p>

<p>I83</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>Not yet our feet had on that summit moved, When I discovered that the bank, around, Whose proud uprising all ascent denied, Was marble white; and so exactly wrought With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self Been shamed. The Angel (who came down to ei With tidings of the peace so many years Wept for in vain, that oped the heavenly gates From their long interdict) before us seem'd, In a sweet act, so sculptured to the life, He look'd no silent image. One had sworn He had said "Hail!" for she was imaged there, By whom the key did open to God's love; And in her act as sensibly imprest That word, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord," As figure seal'd on wax. "Fix not thy mind On one place only," said the guide beloved, Who had me near him on that part where lies The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn'd, And mark'd, behind the Virgin Mother's form, Upon that side where he that moved me stood, Another story graven on the rock.</p>

<p>I past athwart the bard, and drew me near, That it might stand more aptly for my view. There, in the self-same marble, were engraved The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark, That from unbidden office awes mankind. Before it came much people; and the whole Parted in seven quires. One sense cried "Nay," Another, "Yes, they sing." Like doubt arose Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil. Preceding the blest vessel, onward came With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise, Israel's sweet harper: in that hap he seem'd Less, and yet more, than kingly. Opposite At a great palace, from the lattice forth Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,</p>

<p>canto x PURGATORY 185</p>

<p>Which, at the back of Michol, whitely shone, I moved me. There, was storied on the rock The exalted glory of the Roman prince, Whose mighty worth moved Gregory1 to earn His mighty conquest, Trajan the Emperor. A widow at his bridle stood, attired In tears and mourning. Round about them troop'd Full throng of knights; and overhead in gold The eagles floated, struggling with the wind. The wretch appear'd amid all these to say: "Grant vengeance, Sire! for, woe beshrew this heart, My son is murder'd." He replying seem'd: "Wait now till I return." And she, as one Made hasty by her grief: "O Sire! if thou Dost not return?""Where I am, who then is, May right thee.""What to thee is other's good, If thou neglect thy own?""Now comfort thee;" At length he answers. "It beseemeth well My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence: So justice wills; and pity bids me stay."</p>

<p>He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produced That visible speaking, new to us and strange, The like not found on earth. Fondly I gazed Upon those patterns of meek humbleness, Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake; When "Lo!" the poet whispcr'd, "where this way (But slack their pace) a multitude advance, These to the lofty steps shall guide us on."</p>

<p>Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights, Their loved allurement, were not slow to turn.</p>

<p>Reader! I would not that amazed thou miss Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God Decrees our debts be cancel'd. Ponder not The form of suffering. Think on what succeeds: Think that, at worst, beyond the mighty doom It cannot pass. "Instructor!" I began, "What I see hither tending, bears no trace Of human semblance, nor of aught beside</p>

<p>That my foil'd sight can guess." He answering thus:</p>

<p>"So curb'd to earth, beneath their heavy terms</p>

<p>Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first</p>

<p>Struggled as thine. But look intendy thither;</p>

<p>And disentangle with thy laboring view,</p>

<p>What, underneath those stones, approacheth: now,</p>

<p>E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each."</p>

<p>Christians and proud! O poor and wretched onesl That, feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust Upon unstaid perverseness: know ye not That we are worms, yet made at last to form The winged insect,2 imp'd with angel plumes, That to Heaven's justice unobstructed soars? Why buoy ye up aloft your unfledged souls? Abortive then and shapeless ye remain, Like the untimely embryon of a worm.</p>

<p>As, to support incumbent floor or roof, For corbel, is a figure sometimes seen, That crumples up its knees unto its breast; With the feign'd posture, stirring ruth unfeign'd In the beholder's fancy; so I saw These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.</p>

<p>Each, as his back was laden, came indeed Or more or less contracted; and it seem'd As he, who show'd most patience in his look, Wailing exclaim'd: "I can endure no more."</p>

<p>CANTO XI</p>

<p>Argument.After a prayer uttered by the spirits, who were spoken of in the last Canto, Virgil inquires the way upward, and is answered by one, who declares himself to have been Omberto, son of the Count of Santafiore. Next our Poet distinguishes Oderigi, the illuminator, who discourses on the vanity of worldly fame, and points out to him the soul of Provcnzano Salvani.</p>

<p>OTHOU Almighty Father! who dost make The heavens Thy dwelling, not in bounds confined,</p>

<p>But that, with love intenser, there Thou view'st Thy primal effluence; hallow'd be Thy name: Join, each created being, to extol</p>

<p>a "The winged insect." The butterfly was an ancient and well-known symbol of the</p>

<p>human soul.</p>

<p>PURGATORY</p>

<p>Thy might; for worthy humblest thanks and praise</p>

<p>Is Thy blest Spirit. May Thy kingdom's peace</p>

<p>Come unto us; for we, unless it come,</p>

<p>With all our striving, thither tend in vain.</p>

<p>As, of their will, the Angels unto Thee</p>

<p>Tender meet sacrifice, circling Thy throne</p>

<p>With loud hosannas; so of theirs be done</p>

<p>By saintly men on earth. Grant us, this day,</p>

<p>Our daily manna, without which he roams</p>

<p>Through this rough desert retrograde, who most</p>

<p>Toils to advance his steps. As we to each</p>

<p>Pardon the evil done us, pardon Thou</p>

<p>Benign, and of our merit take no count.</p>

<p>'Gainst the old adversary, prove Thou not</p>

<p>Our virtue, easily subdued; but free</p>

<p>From his incitements, and defeat his wiles.</p>

<p>This last petition, dearest Lord! is made</p>

<p>Not for ourselves; since that were needless now;</p>

<p>But for their sakes who after us remain."</p>

<p>Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring, Those spirits went beneath a weight like that We sometimes feel in dreams; all, sore beset, But with unequal anguish; wearied all; Round the first circuit; purging as they go The world's gross darkness off. In our behoof If their vows still be offer'd, what can here For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills Have root of goodness in them? Well beseems That we should help them wash away the stains They carried hence; that so, made pure and light, They may spring upward to the starry spheres.</p>

<p>"Ah! so may mercy-temper'd justice rid Your burdens speedily; that ye have power To stretch your wing, which e'en to your desire Shall lift you; as ye show us on which hand Toward the ladder leads the shortest way. And if there be more passages than one, Instruct us of that easiest to ascend: For this man, who comes with me, and bears yet The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,</p>

<p>From whom the answer came unto these words,</p>

<p>Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said:</p>

<p>That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith</p>

They leave the first cornice, and are ushered to the next by an angel who points out the way.</p>

<p>WITH equal pace, as oxen in the yoke, I, with that laden spirit, journey'd on, Long as the mild instructor suffer'd me; But, when he bade me quit him, and proceed, (For "Here," said he, "behoves with sail and oars Each man, as best he may, push on his bark,") Upright, as one disposed for speed, I raised My body, still in thought submissive bow'd.</p>

<p>I now my leader's track not loth pursued; And each had shown how light we fared along, When thus he warned me: "Bend thine eyesight down, For thou, to ease the way, shalt find it good To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet."</p>

<p>As, in memorial of the buried, drawn Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptured form Of what was once, appears, (at sight whereof Tears often stream forth, by remembrance waked, Whose sacred stings the piteous often feel), So saw I there, but with more curious skill Of portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space From forth the mountain stretches. On one part Him I beheld, above all creatures erst Created noblest, lightening fall from Heaven: On the other side, with bolt celestial pierced, Briareus; cumbering earth he lay, through dint Of mortal ice-stroke. The Thymbraran god,1 With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire, Arm'd still, and gazing on the giants' limbs Strewn o'er the ethereal field. Nimrod I saw: At foot of the stupendous work he stood, As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain. O Niobe! in what a trance of woe ' "The Thymbraan god."   Apollo.</p>

Was shown how routed in the battle fled The Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en The relics of the carnage. Troy I mark'd, In ashes and in caverns. Oh! how fallen, How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there.</p>

The church of San Miniato in Florence, situated on a height that overlooks the Arno, where it is crossed by the bridge Rubaconte, so called from Mcsser Rubaconte da Man-della, of Milan, chief magistrate of Florence, by whom the bridge was founded in 1237.

But fix thine eyes Intently through the air; and thou shalt see A multitude before thee seated, each Along the shelving grot."

E'en thus the blind and poor, Near the confessionals, to crave an alms, Stand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk; So most to stir compassion, not by sound Of words alone, but that which moves not less, The sight of misery. And as never beam Of noon-day visiteth the eyeless man, E'en so was heaven a niggard unto these Of his fair light: for, through the orbs of all, A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up, As for the taming of a haggard hawk. It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look On others, yet myself the while unseen. To my sage counsel therefore did I turn. He knew the meaning of the mute appeal, Nor waited for my questioning, but said: "Speak; and be brief, be subtile in thy words."</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xv</p>

<p>CANTO XV</p>

<p>Argument.An Angel invites them to ascend the next steep. On their way Dante suggests certain doubts, which arc resolved by Virgil; and, when they reach the third cornice, where the sin of anger is purged, our Poet, in a kind of waking dream, beholds remarkable instances of patience; and soon after they arc enveloped in a dense fog.</p>

<p>AS much as 'twixt the third hour's close and dawn, / \   Appeareth of Heaven's sphere, that ever whirls J   \. As restless as an infant in his play; So much appear'd remaining to the sun Of his slope journey towards the western goal.</p>

<p>Evening was there, and here the noon of night; And full upon our forehead smote the beams. For round the mountain, circling, so our path Had led us, that toward the sunset now Direct we journey'd; when I felt a weight Of more exceeding splendour, than before, Press on my front. The cause unknown, amaze Possess'd me! and both hands against my brows Lifting, I interposed them, as a screen, That of its gorgeous superflux of light Clips the diminish'd orb. As when the ray, Striking on water or the surface clear Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part, Ascending at a glance, e'en as it fell, And as much differs from the stone, that falls Through equal space, (so practic skill hath shown); Thus, with refracted light, before me seem'd The ground there smitten; whence, in sudden haste, My sight recoil'd. "What is this, sire beloved! 'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?" Cried I, "and which toward us moving seems?"</p>

<p>"Marvel not, if the family of Heaven," He answer'd, "yet with dazzling radiance dim Thy sense. It is a messenger who comes, Inviting man's ascent. Such sights ere long, Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight, As thy perception is by nature wrought Up to their pitch." The blessed Angel, soon</p>

<p>As we had reach'd him, hail'd us with glad voice: "Here enter on a ladder far less steep Than ye have yet encounter'd." We forthwith Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet, "Blessed the merciful," 1 and "Happy thou, That conquer'st." Lonely each, my guide and I, Pursued our upward way; and as we went, Some profit from his words I hoped to win, And thus of him inquiring, framed my speech: "What meant Romagna's spirit,2 when he spake Of bliss exclusive, with no partner shared?"</p>

<p>He straight replied: "No wonder, since he knows What sorrow waits on his own worst defect, If he chide others, that they less may mourn. Because ye point your wishes at a mark, Where, by communion of possessors, part Is lessen'd, envy bloweth up men's sighs. No fear of that might touch ye, if the love Of higher sphere exalted your desire. For there, by how much more they call it ours. So much propriety of each in good Encreases more, and heighten'd charity Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame."</p>

<p>"Now lack I satisfaction more," said I, "Than if thou hadst been silent at the first; And doubt more gathers on my labouring thought. How can it chance, that good distributed, The many, that possess it, makes more rich, Than if't were shared by few?" He answering thus: "Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth, Strikes darkness from true light. The highest Good Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed To love, as beam to lucid body darts, Giving as much of ardour as it finds. The sempiternal effluence streams abroad. Spreading, wherever charity extends;. So that the more aspirants to that bliss Are multiplied, more good is there to love, And more is loved; as mirrors, that reflect, 1 "Blessed the merciful."

<p>Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,</p>

<p>That, when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal."</p>

<p>"Thou," I had said, "content'st me"; when I saw The other round was gain'd, and wondering eyes Did keep me mute. There suddenly I seem'd By an ecstatic vision wrapt away; And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd Of many persons; and at the entrance stood A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express A mother's love, who said, "Child! why hast thou Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I Sorrowing have sought thee"; and so held her peace; And straight the vision fled. A female next Appear'd before me, down whose visage coursed Those waters, that grief forces out from one By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say: 'If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed Over this city,' named with such debate Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles, Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace Hath clasp'd our daughter"; and to her, meseem'd, Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd, Her sovran spake: "How shall we those requite4 Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn The man that loves us?" After that I saw A multitude, in fury burning, slay With stones a stripling youth,4 and shout amain "Destroy, destroy"; and him I saw, who bow'd</p>

<p>8 "Over this city." Athens, named after Minerva (A&7*i)), in consequence of her having produced a more valuable gift for it in the olive than Neptune had done in the horse.</p>

<p>4 "How shall we those requite?" The answer of Pisistratus the tyrant to</p>

<p>his wife, when she urged him to inflict the punishment of death on a young man, who, inflamed with love for his daughter, had snatched a kiss from her in public.</p>

<p>Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to Heaven, Praying forgiveness of the Almighty Sire, Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes, With looks that win compassion to their aim.</p>

<p>Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight Returning, sought again the things whose truth Depends not on her shaping, I observed She had not roved to falsehood in her dreams.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the leader, who might see I moved As one who struggles to shake off his sleep, Exclaim'd: "What ails thee, that thou canst not hold Thy footing firm; but more than half a league Hast travel'd with closed eyes and tottering gait, Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharged?"</p>

<p>"Beloved father! so thou deign," said I, "To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd Before me, when so fail'd my sinking steps."</p>

<p>He thus: "Not if thy countenance were mask'd With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine, How small soe'er, elude me. What thou saw'st Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart To the waters of peace, that flow diffused From their eternal fountain. I not ask'd, What ails thee? for such cause as he doth, who Looks only with that eye, which sees no more, When spiritless the body lies; but ask'd, To give fresh vigour to thy foot. Such goads, The slow and loitering need; that they be found Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns."</p>

<p>So on we journey'd, through the evening sky Gazing intent, far onward as our eyes, With level view, could stretch against the bright Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees Gathering, a fog made towards us, dark as night. There was no room for 'scaping; and that mist Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air.</p>

<p>208 THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xvi</p>

<p>CANTO XVI</p>

<p>Argument.As they proceed through the mist, they hear the voices of spirits praying. Marco Lombardo, one of these, points out to Dante the error of such as impute our actions to necessity; explains to him that man is endued with free will; and shows that much of human depravity results from the undue mixture of spiritual and temporal authority in rulers.</p>

<p>HELL'S dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark, Of every planet 'reft, and pall'd in clouds, Did never spread before the sight a veil In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense So palpable and gross. Entering its shade, Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids; Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide, Offering me his shoulder for a stay.</p>

<p>As the blind man behind his leader walks, Lest he should err, or stumble unawares On what might harm him or perhaps destroy; I journey'd through that bitter air and foul, Still listening to my escort's warning voice, "Look that from me thou part not." Straight I heard Voices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace, And for compassion, to the Lamb of God That taketh sins away. Their prelude still Was "Agnus Dei"; and through all the choir, One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd The concord of their song. "Are these I hear Spirits, O master?" I exclaim'd; and he, "Thou aim'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath."</p>

<p>"Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave, And speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet Dividedst time by calends?" So one voice Bespake me; whence my master said, "Reply; And ask, if upward hence the passage lead."</p>

<p>"O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand Beautiful once more in thy Maker's sight; Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder." Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake: "Long as 'tis lawful for me, shall my steps Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke</p>

<p>canto xvi PURGATORY 209</p>

<p>Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead Shall keep us join'd." I then forthwith began: "Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend To higher regions; and am hither come Thorough the fearful agony of Hell. And, if so largely God hath doled His grace, That, clean beside all modern precedent, He wills me to behold His kingly state; From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death Had loosed thee; but instruct me: and instruct If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words The way directing, as a safe escort."</p>

<p>"I was of Lombardy, and Marco call'd:1 Not inexperienced of the world, that worth I still affected, from which all have turn'd The nerveless bow aside. Thy course tends right Unto the summit:" and, replying thus, He added, "I beseech thee pray for me, When thou shalt come aloft." And I to him: "Accept my faith for pledge I will perform What thou requirest. Yet one doubt remains, That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not. Singly before it urged me, doubled now By thine opinion, when I couple that With one elsewhere declared; each strengthening other. The world indeed is even so forlorn Of all good, as thou speak'st it, and so swarms With every evil. Yet, beseech thee, point The cause out to me, that myself may see, And unto others show it: for in Heaven One places it, and one on earth below."</p>

<p>Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,</p>

<p>"Brother!" he thus began, "the world is blind;</p>

Of some slight good The flavour soon she tastes; and, snared by that, With fondness she pursues it; if no guide Recall, no rein direct her wandering course. Hence it behoved, the law should be a curb; A sovereign hence behoved, whose piercing view Might mark at least the fortress2 and main tower Of the true city. Laws indeed there are: But who is he observes them? None; not he, Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,</p>

<p>1 Justice, the most necessary virtue in the chief magistrate, as the commentators for the most part explain it. Sec also Dante's De Monarchic, book I. Yet Lombardi understands the law here spoken of</p>

<p>to be the law of God; "the sovereign," a spiritual ruler, and "the true city," the society of true believers; so that "the fortress," according to him, denotes the principal parts of Christian duty.</p>

<p>"Either thy words," said he, "deceive, or else Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan, Appear'st not to have heard of good Gherardo; The sole addition that, by which I know him; Unless I borrow'd from his daughter Gai'a10 Another name to grace him. God be with you. I bear you company no more. Behold The dawn with white ray glimmering through the mist. I must awaythe angel comesere he Appear." He said, and would not hear me more.</p>

<p>CANTO XVII</p>

<p>Argument.The Poet issues from that thick vapour; and soon after his fancy represents to him in lively portraiture some noted examples of anger. This imagination is dissipated by the appearance of an angel, who marshals them onward to the fourth cornice, on which the sin of gloominess or indifference is purged; and here Virgil shows him that this vice proceeds from a defect of love, and that all love can be only of two sorts, either natural, or of the soul; of which sorts the former is always right, but the latter may err either in respect of object or of degree.</p>

<p>CALL to remembrance, reader, if thou e'er Hast on an Alpine height been ta'en by cloud, Through which thou saw'st no better than the mole Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene'er The watery vapours dense began to melt Into thin air, how faintly the sun's sphere Seem'd wading through them: so thy nimble thought May image, how at first I rebeheld The sun, that bedward now his couch o'erhung.</p>

<p>O quick and forgetive power I that sometimes dost So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark Though round about us thousand trumpets clang; What moves thee, if the senses stir not? Light Moves thee from Heaven, spontaneous, self-inform'd; Or, likelier, gliding down with swift illapse By will divine. Portray'd before me came The traces of her dire impiety, Whose form was changed into the bird, that most Delights itself in song:1 and here my mind Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place To aught that ask'd admittance from without. Next shower'd into my fantasy a shape As of one crucified, whose visage spake Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died; And round him Ahasuerus the great king; Esther his bride; and Mordecai the just, Blameless in word and deed. As of itself That unsubstantial coinage of the brain Burst, like a bubble, when the water fails That fed it; in my vision straight uprose A damsel1 weeping loud, and cried, "O queenl O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire Driven thee to loathe thy being?

<p>In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd</p>

<p>Now to such height above our heads were raised The last beams, follow'd close by hooded night, That many a star on all sides through the gloom Shone out. "Why partest from me, O my strength?" So with myself I communed; for I felt My o'ertoil'd sinews slacken. We had reach'd The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark Arrived at land. And waiting a short space, If aught should meet mine ear in that new round, Then to my guide I turn'd, and said: "Loved sire! Declare what guilt is on this circle purged. If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause."</p>

While e'er it seeks The primal blessings,5 or with measure due The inferior,4 no delight, that flows from it, Partakes of ill. But let it warp to evil, Or with more ardour than behoves, or less, Pursue the good; the thing created then Works 'gainst its Maker. Hence thou must infer That love is germin of each virtue in ye, And of each act no less, that merits pain.

<p>"Grant the distinction just; and it remains The evil must be another's, which is loved. Three ways such love is gender'd in your clay. There is6 who hopes (his neighbour's worth deprest) Pre-eminence himself; and covets hence, For his own greatness, that another fall. There is7 who so much fears the loss of power, Fame, favour, glory, (should his fellow mount Above him), and so sickens at the thought, He loves their opposite: and there is he,' Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame, That he doth thirst for vengeance; and such needs Must dote on other's evil.

Other good There is, where man finds not his happiness: It is not true fruition; not that blest Essence, of every good the branch and root.

<p>Argument.Virgil discourses further concerning the nature of love. Then a multitude of spirits rush by; two of whom, in van of the rest, record instances of zeal and fervent affection, and another, who was Abbot of San Zeno in Verona, declares himself to Virgil and Dante; and lastly follow other spirits, shouting forth memorable examples of the sin for which they suffer. The Poet, pursuing his meditations, falls into a dreamy slumber.</p>

<p>THE teacher ended, and his high discourse Concluding, earnest in my looks inquired If I appear'd content; and I, whom still Unsated thirst to hear him urged, was mute, Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said: "Perchance my too much questioning offends." But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish By diffidence restrain'd; and, speaking, gave Me boldness thus to speak: "Master! my sight Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams, That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen. Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart Holds dearest, thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold That love, from which, as from their source, thou bring'st All good deeds and their opposite."

When lo! even as Luke2 relates, that Christ Appear'd unto the two upon their way, New-risen from His vaulted grave; to us A shade appear'd, and after us approach'd, Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet. We were not ware of it; so first it spake, Saying, "God give you peace, my brethren!" then Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute, As fitted that kind greeting, gave; and cried: "Peace in the blessed council be thy lot, Awarded by that righteous court which me To everlasting banishment exiles."</p>

<p>"How!" he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile Desisting; "If that ye be spirits whom God Vouchsafes not room above; who up the height Has been thus far your guide?" To whom the bard: "If thou observe the tokens,' which this man, Traced by the finger of the Angel, bears; 'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just He needs must share.

<p>That questioning so tallied with my wish, The thirst did feel abatement of its edge E'en from expectance.  He forthwith replied: "In its devotion, nought irregular This mount can witness, or by punctual rule Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt, Other than that, which Heaven in itself Doth of itself receive, no influence Can reach us. Tempest none, shower, hail, or snow, Hoar frost, or dewy moistness, higher falls Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds, Nor scudding rack, are ever seen: swift glance Ne'er lightens; nor Thaumantian Iris gleams, That yonder often shifts on each side Heaven. Vapour adust doth never mount above The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon Peter's vicegerent stands.  Lower perchance, With various motion rock'd, trembles the soil: But here, through wind in earth's deep hollow pent, I know not how, yet never trembled: then Trembles, when any spirit feels itself So purified, that it may rise, or move For rising; and such loud acclaim ensues. Purification, by the will alone, Is proved, that free to change society Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will. Desire of bliss is present from the first; But strong propension hinders, to that wish By the just ordinance of Heaven opposed; Propension now as eager to fulfill The allotted torment, as erewhile to sin. And I, who in this punishment had lain Five hundred years and more, but now have felt Free wish for happier clime.  Therefore thou fclt'st</p>

<p>Argument.Dante, Virgil, and Statius mount to the sixth cornice, where the sin of gluttony is cleansed, the two Latin Poets discoursing by the way. Turning to the right, they find a tree hung with sweet-smelling fruit, and watered by a shower that issues from the rock. Voices are heard to proceed from among the leaves, recording examples of temperance.</p>

<p>NOW we had left the Angel, who had turn'd To the sixth circle our ascending step; One gash from off my forehead razed; while they,</p>

I had met The fierce encounter of the voluble rock. Then was 1 ware that, with too ample wing, The hands may haste to lavishment; and turn'd, As from my other evil, so from this, In penitence.

And know, The fault, which lies direct from any sin In level opposition, here, with that, Wastes its green rankness on one common heap.

The contemporary annalist, after relating at length the circumstances of his fate, adds, "that he was one of the wisest and most</p>

<p>valorous knights, the best speaker, the most expert statesman, the most renowned and enterprising man of his age in Italy, a comely knight and of graceful carriage, but very worldly, and in his time had formed many conspiracies in Florence, and entered into many scandalous practices for the sake of attaining state and lordship."

<p>"How long my life may last," said I, "I know not: This know, how soon soever I return, My wishes will before me have arrived: Sithence the place,5 where I am set to live, Is, day by day, more scoop'd of all its good; And dismal ruin seems to threaten it."</p>

<p>"Go now," he cried:  "lo! he," whose guilt is most, Passes before my vision, dragg'd at heels Of an infuriate beast. Toward the vale, Where guilt hath no redemption, on its speeds, Each step increasing swiftness on the last; Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him A corse most vilely shatter'd. No long space Those wheels have yet to roll," (therewith his eyes Look'd up to Heaven,) "ere thou shalt plainly see That which my words may not more plainly tell. I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose Too much, thus measuring my pace with thine."</p>

<p>As from a troop of well-rank'd chivalry, One knight, more enterprising than the rest, Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display His prowess in the first encounter proved; So parted he from us, with lengthen'd strides; And left me on the way with those twain spirits, Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</p>

<p>When he beyond us had so fled, mine eyes No nearer reach'd him, than my thoughts his words, The branches of another fruit, thick hung, And blooming fresh, appear'd. E'en as our steps Turn'd thither; not far off, it rose to view. Beneath it were a multitude, that raised Their hands, and shouted forth I know not what Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats, That beg, and answer none obtain from him, Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on, He, at arm's length, the object of their wish Above them holds aloft, and hides it not.</p>

<p>At length, as undeceived, they went their way: And we approach the tree, whom vows and tears Sue to in vain; the mighty tree.  "Pass on, And come not near.

Such sounds from midst the thickets came Whence I, with either bard, close to the side That rose, pass'd forth beyond.

<p>CANTO XXV</p>

<p>Argument.Virgil and Statius resolve some doubts that have arisen in the mind of Dante from what he had just seen. They all arrive on the seventh and last cornice, where the sin of incontinence is purged in fire; and the spirits of those suffering therein are heard to record illustrious instances of chastity.</p>

<p>IT was an hour, when he who climbs, had need To walk uncrippled: for the sun1 had now To Taurus the meridian circle left, And to the Scorpion left the night. As one, That makes no pause, but presses on his road, Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need Impel; so enter'd we upon our way, One before other; for, but singly, none That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.</p>

<p>E'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit The nest, and drops it; so in me desire Of questioning my guide arose, and fell, Arriving even to the act that marks A man prepared for speech.

<p>1 Virgil reminds Dante that, as Meleager was wasted away by the decree of the fates, and not through want of blood; so by the divine appointment, there may be leanness where there is no need of nourishment.</p>

<p>3 As the reflection of a form in a mirror is modified with the modification of the form itself; so the soul, separated from the earthly body, impresses the ghost of that body with its own affections.</p>

<p>Stands trembling for its flight." Encouraged thus, I straight began: "How there can leanness come, Where is no want of nourishment to feed?"</p>

<p>"If thou," he answer'd, "hadst remember'd thee, How Meleager1 with the wasting brand Wasted alike, by equal fires consumed; This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought, How in the mirror3 your reflected form With mimic motion vibrates; what now seems Hard, had appear'd no harder than the pulp Of summer-fruit mature.  But that thy will In certainty may find its full repose, Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray That he would now be healer of thy wound."</p>

<p>"If, in thy presence, I unfold to him The secrets of Heaven's vengeance, let me plead Thine own injunction to exculpate me." So Statius answer'd, and forthwith began: "Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind Receive them; so shall they be light to clear The doubt thou offer'st.  Blood, concocted well, Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbibed, And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en From the replenish'd table, in the heart Derives effectual virtue, that informs The several human limbs, as being that Which passes through the veins itself to make them. Yet more concocted it descends, where shame Forbids to mention: and from thence distils In natural vessel on another's blood.

<p>Tlie casual beam refracting, decks itself With many a hue; so here the ambient air Weareth that form, which influence of the soul Imprints on it: and like the flame, that where The fire moves, thither follows; so, henceforth, The new form on the spirit follows still: Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call'd, With each sense, even to the sight, indued: Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs, Which thou mayst oft have witness'd on the mount.

<p>Now the last flexure of our way we reach'd; And to the right hand turning, other care Awaits us. Here the rocky precipice Hurls forth redundant flames; and from the rim A blast up-blown, with forcible rebuff Driveth them back, sequester'd from its bound.</p>

<p>Argument.The spirits wonder at seeing the shadow cast by the body of Dante on the flame as he passes it. This moves one of them to address him. It proves to be Guido Guinicelli. the Italian poet, who points out to him the spirit of Arnault Daniel, the Provencal, with whom he also speaks.</p>

<p>WHILE singly thus along the rim we walk'd, Oft the good master warn'd me:  "Look thou Avail it that I caution thee." The sun     [well. Now all the western clime irradiate changed From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass'd, My passing shadow made the umber'd flame Burn ruddier. At so strange a sight I mark'd That many a spirit marvel'd on his way.</p>

<p>This bred occasion first to speak of me. "He seems," said they, "no insubstantial frame:" Then, to obtain what certainty they might, Stretch'd tow'rd me, careful not to overpass The burning pale. "O thou! who followest The others, haply not more slow than they, But moved by reverence; answer me, who burn In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth Indian or .rEthiop for the cooling stream. Tell us, how is it that thou makest thyself A wall against the sun, as thou not yet Into the inextricable toils of death Hadst enter'd?" Thus spake one; and I had straight Declared me, if attention had not turn'd To new appearance.   Meeting these, there came, Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom Earnestly gazing, from each part I view The shadows all press forward, severally Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.</p>

<p>E'en so the emmets, 'mid their dusky troops,</p>

<p>That friendly greeting parted, ere despatch Of the first onward step, from either tribe Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come, Shout "Sodom and Gomorrah!" these, "The cow Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd Might rush unto her luxury."

<p>Again drew near my side the very same, Who had erewhile besought me; and their looks Mark'd eagerness to listen.  I, who twice Their will had noted, spake:   "O spirits! secure, Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end; My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age, Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed With blood, and sinew-strung.

<p>I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew A little onward, and besought his name, For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room. He frankly thus began: "Thy courtesy4 So wins on me, I have nor power nor will To hide me.

They have not proceeded many steps on their way upward, when the fall of night hinders them from going further; and our Poet, who has lain down with Virgil and Statius to rest, beholds in a dream two females, figuring the active and contemplative life. With the return of morning, they reach the height; and here Virgil gives Dante full liberty to use his own pleasure and judgment in the choice of his way, till he shall meet with Beatrice.</p>

<p>NOW was the sun1 so station'd, as when first His early radiance quivers on the heights, Where stream'd his Maker's blood; while Libra hangs</p>

<p>Above Hesperian Ebro; and new fires, Meridian, flash on Ganges' yellow tide.</p>

<p>So day was sinking, when the Angel of God Appear'd before us. Joy was in his mien. Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink; And with a voice, whose lively clearness far Surpass'd our human, "Blessed2 are the pure In heart," he sang: then near him as we came, "Go ye not further, holy spirits!" he cried, "Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list Attentive to the song ye hear from thence."</p>

<p>I, when I heard his saying, was as one Laid in the grave.  My hands together clasp'd, And upward stretching, on the fire I look'd; And busy fancy conjured up the forms Erewhile beheld alive consumed in flames.</p>

<p>The escorting spirits turn'd with gentle looks Toward me; and the Mantuan spake:   "My son, Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death. Remember thee, remember thee, if I Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee; now I come More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?</p>

<p>I still, though conscience urged, no step advanced.</p>

<p>When still he saw me fix'd and obstinate. Somewhat disturb'd he cried:  "Mark now, my son, From Beatrice thou art by this wall Divided."  As at Thisbe's name the eye Of Pyramus was open'd, (when life ebb'd Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance, While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard The name that springs forever in my breast.</p>

<p>He shook his forehead; and, "How long," he said, "Linger we now?" then smiled, as one would smile Upon a child that eyes the fruit and yields. Into the fire before me then he walk'd; And Statius, who erewhile no little space Had parted us, he pray'd to come behind.</p>

<p>I would have cast me into molten glass To cool me, when I enter'd; so intense Raged the conflagrant mass. The sire beloved, To comfort me, as he proceeded, still Of Beatrice talk'd. "Her eyes," saith he, "E'en now I seem to view." From the other side A voice, that sang, did guide us; and the voice Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth, There where the path led upward. "Come," 3 we heard, "Come, blessed of my Father."  Such the sounds, That hail'd us from within a light, which shone So radiant, I could not endure the view. "The sun," it added, "hastes: and evening comes. Delay not: ere the western sky is hung With blackness, strive ye for the pass." Our way Upright within the rock arose, and faced Such part of heaven, that from before my steps '"Come."Matt. xxv. 34.</p>

As the goats, That late have skipt and wanton'd rapidly Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en Their supper on the herb, now silent lie And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown, While noon-day rages; and the goatherd leans Upon his staff, and leaning watches them: And as the swain, that lodges out all night In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey Disperse them: even so all three abode, I as a goat, and as the shepherds they, Close pent on either side by shelving rock.</p>

<p>A little glimpse of sky was seen above; Yet by that litde I beheld the stars, In magnitude and lustre shining forth With more than wonted glory.   As I lay, Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft Tidings of future hap. About the hour, As I believe, when Venus from the east First lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb Seems always glowing with the fire of love, A lady young and beautiful, I dream'd, Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she came, Methought I saw her ever and anon Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang: "Know ye, whoever of my name would ask, That I am Leah:4 for my brow to weave</p>

<p>And now as glimmering dawn appear'd, that breaks More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he Sojourns less distant on his homeward way, Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled My slumber; whence I rose, and saw my guide Already risen.  "That delicious fruit, Which through so many a branch the zealous care Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day Appease thy hunger."  Such the words I heard From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard, So pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight Desire so grew upon desire to mount, Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings Increasing for my flight.  When we had run O'er all the ladder to its topmost round, As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd His eyes, and thus he spake:   "Both fires, my son, The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen; And art arrived, where of itself my ken No further reaches.

<p>CANTO XXVIII</p>

<p>Argument.Dante wanders through the forest of the terrestrial Paradise, till he is stopped by a stream, on the other side of which he beholds a fair lady, culling flowers. He speaks to her; and she, in reply, explains to him certain things touching the nature of that place, and tells that the water, which flows between them, is here called Lethe, and in another place has the name of Eunoe.</p>

<p>THROUGH that celestial forest, whose thick shade With lively greenness the new-springing day Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and search Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank; Along the champain leisurely my way Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all sides Delicious odour breathed.  A pleasant air, That intermitted never, never veer'd, Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind Of softest influence: at which the sprays, Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part1 Where first the holy mountain casts his shade; Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still Upon their top the feather'd quiristers Applied their wonted art, and with full joy Welcomed those hours of prime, and warbled shrill Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays Kept tenour; even as from branch to branch, Along the piny forests on the shore Of Chiassi, rolls the gathering melody, When Eolus hath from his cavern loosed The dripping south.   Already had my steps, Though slow, so far into that ancient wood Transported me, I could not ken the place Where I had enter'd; when, behold! my path Was bounded by a rill, which, to the left, With litde rippling waters bent the grass That issued from its brink.  On earth no wave How clean soe'er, that would not seem to have 1 "To that part." The west.</p>

<p>Some mixture in itself, compared with this, Transpicuous clear; yet darkly on it roll'd, Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne'er Admits or sun or moon-light there to shine.</p>

<p>My feet advanced not; but my wondering eyes Pass'd onward, o'er the streamlet to survey The tender May-bloom, flush'd through many a hue, In prodigal variety: and there, As object, rising suddenly to view, That from our bosom every thought beside With the rare marvel chases, I beheld A lady2 all alone, who, singing, went, And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way Was all o'er painted.  "Lady beautiful! Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart, Art worthy of our trust) with love's own beam Dost warm thee," thus to her my speech I framed; "Ah! please thee hither toward the streamlet bend Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song. Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks, I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd Proserpine, in that season, when her child The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring."</p>

<p>As when a lady, turning in the dance, Doth foot it feady, and advances scarce One step before the other to the ground; Over the yellow and vermilion flowers, Thus turn'd she at my suit, most maiden-like Valing her sober eyes; and came so near, That I distincdy caught the dulcet sound. Arriving where the limpid waters now Laved the greensward, her eyes she deign'd to raise, That shot such splendour on me, as I ween Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's, when her son Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart. Upon the opposite bank she stood and smiled; As through her graceful fingers shifted still</p>

By the stream Three paces only were we sunder'd: yet, The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er, (A curb for ever to the pride of man,') Was by Leander not more hateful held For floating, with inhospitable wave, 'Twixt Sestos and Abydos, than by me That flood, because it gave no passage thence.</p>

<p>"Strangers ye come; and haply in this place, That cradled human nature in its birth, Wondering, ye not without suspicion view My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody, 'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,' * will give ye light, Which may uncloud your minds. And thou, who stand'st The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me, Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine."</p>

Nor our way Far onward brought us, when to me at once She turn'd, and cried:  "My brother! look, and hearken." And lo! a sudden lustre ran across Through the great forest on all parts, so bright, I doubted whether lightning were abroad; But that, expiring ever in the spleen</p>

<p>Ran through the luminous air. Then did I chide,</p>

<p>With warrantable zeal, the hardihood</p>

<p>Of our first parent; for that there, where earth</p>

<p>Stood in obedience to the Heavens, she only,</p>

<p>Woman, the creature of an hour, endured not</p>

<p>Restraint of any veil, which had she borne</p>

<p>Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,</p>

<p>Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.</p>

<p>While, through that wilderness of primy sweets That never fade, suspense I walk'd, and yet Expectant of beatitude more high; Before us, like a blazing fire, the air Under the green boughs glow'd; and, for a song, Distinct the sound of melody was heard.</p>

<p>O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes If e'er I suffer'd hunger, cold, and watching, Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty. Now through my breast let Helicon his stream Pour copious, and Urania2 with her choir Arise to aid me; while the verse unfolds Things, that do almost mock the grasp of thought.</p>

<p>Onward a space, what seem'd seven trees of gold The intervening distance to mine eye Falsely presented; but, when I was come So near them, that no lineament was lost Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense; Then did the faculty, that ministers Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold* Distinguish; and i' the singing trace the sound "Hosanna!" Above, their beauteous garniture Flamed with more ample lustre, than the moon Through cloudless sky at midnight, in her noon.</p>

<p>The lady call'd aloud:  "Why thus yet burns Affection in thee for these living lights, And dost not look on that which follows them?"</p>

<p>I straightway mark'd a tribe behind them walk, As if attendant on their leaders, clothed With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth Was never.   On my left, the watery gleam Borrow'd, and gave me back, when there I look'd, As in a mirror, my left side portray'd.</p>

<p>When I had chosen on the river's edge Such station, that the distance of the stream Alone did separate me; there I stay'd My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld The flames go onward, leaving, as they went, The air behind them painted as with trail Of liveliest pencils; so distinct were mark'd All those seven listed colours, whence the sun Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone. These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond My vision; and ten paces, as I guess, Parted the outermost.  Beneath a sky So beautiful, came four and twenty elders,4 By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown'd. All sang one song:   "Blessed be thou5 among The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness Blessed forever!" After that the flowers, And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink, Were free from that elected race; as light In heaven doth second light, came after them Four' animals, each crown'd with verdurous leaf. With six wings each was plumed; the plumage full</p>

The members, far As he was bird, were golden; white the rest, With vermeil intervein'd.

<p>Argument.Beatrice continues her reprehension of Dante, who confesses his error, and falls to the ground; coming to himself again, he is by Matilda drawn through the waters of Lethe, and presented first to the four virgins who figure the cardinal virtues; these in their turn lead him to the Gryphon, a symbol of our Saviour; and the three virgins, representing the evangelical virtues, intercede for him with Beatrice, that she would display to him her second beauty.</p>

<p>I Resuming, turn'd their point on me, to whom</p>

<p>They, with but lateral edge,1 seem'd harsh before: "Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream, If this be true. A charge, so grievous, needs Thine own avowal." On my faculty Such strange amazement hung, the voice expired Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.</p>

<p>A little space refraining, then she spake: "What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave On thy remembrances of evil yet Hath done no injury." A mingled sense Of fear and of confusion, from my lips Did such a "Yea" produce, as needed help Of vision to interpret. As when breaks, In act to be discharged, a cross-bow bent Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd; The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark: Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst, Beneath the heavy load: and thus my voice Was slacken'd on its way. She straight began: "When my desire invited thee to love The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings; What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain Did meet thee, that thou so shouldst quit the hope Of further progress? or what bait of ease, Or promise of allurement, led thee on Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere shouldst rather wait?"</p>

<p>Observes it. But whene'er the sinner's cheek</p>

<p>If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,</p>

<p>What, afterward, of mortal, should thy wish</p>

<p>Have tempted ? When thou first hadst felt the dart</p>

<p>Of perishable things, in my departing</p>

<p>I stood, as children silent and ashamed Stand, listening, with their eyes upon the earth, Acknowledging their fault, and self-condemn'd. And she resumed: "If, but to hear, thus pains thee, Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do."</p>

<p>No sooner lifted I mine aspect up, Than I perceived those primal creatures cease Their flowery sprinkling; and mine eyes beheld (Yet unassured and wavering in their view) Beatrice; she, who toward the mystic shape, That joins two natures in one form, had turn'd: And, even under shadow of her veil, And parted by the verdant rill that flow'd Between, in loveliness she seem'd as much Her former self surpassing, as on earth All others she surpass'd. Remorseful goads Shot sudden through me. Each thing else, the more Its love had late beguiled me, now the more Was loathsome. On my heart so keenly smote The bitter consciousness, that on the ground O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then, She knows, who was the cause. When now my strength Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart, The lady,' whom alone I first had seen, I found above me. "Loose me not," she cried: "Loose not thy hold:" and lo! had dragg'd me high As to my neck into the stream; while she, Still as she drew me after, swept along, Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave.</p>

<p>The blessed shore approaching, then was heard So sweedy, "Tu asperges me," that I May not remember, much less tell the sound.</p>

<p>The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd My temples, and immerged me where 'twas fit The wave should drench me: and, thence raising up, Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs Presented me so laved; and with their arm They each did cover me.

<p>"Spare not thy vision. We have station'd thee</p>

<p>Before the emeralds, whence love, erewhile,</p>

Gracious at our prayer, vouchsafe Unveiled to him thy cheeks; that he may mark Thy second beauty, now conceal'd." O splendour!

<p>Argument.Dante is warned not to gaze too fixedly on Beatrice. The procession moves on, accompanied by Matilda, Statius, and Dante, till they reach an exceeding lofty tree, where divers strange chances befall.</p>

<p>MINE eyes with such an eager coveting Were bent to rid them of their ten years' thirst,1 No other sense was waking: and e'en they Were fenced on either side from heed of aught; So tangled, in its custom'd toils, that smile Of saindy brightness drew me to itself: When forcibly, toward the left, my sight The sacred virgins turn'd; for from their lips I heard the warning sounds: "Too fix'd a gaze!"</p>

<p>Awhile my vision labour'd; as when late Upon the o'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote: But soon, to lesser object, as the view Was now recover'd, (lesser in respect To that excess of sensible, whence late I had perforce been sunder'd), on their right I mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn, Against the sun and sevenfold lights, their front. As when, their bucklers for protection raised, A well-ranged troop, with portly banners curl'd, Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground; E'en thus the goodly regiment of Heaven Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car Had sloped his beam. Attendant at the wheels The damsels turn'd; and on the Gryphon moved The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth, No feather on him trembled. The fair dame, Who through the wave had drawn me, companied By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel, Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch. 1 "Their ten years' thirst." Beatrice had been dead ten years.</p>

<p>276 THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xxxn</p>

<p>Through the high wood, now void, (the more her blame, Who by the serpent was beguiled), I pass'd, With step in cadence to the harmony Angelic. Onward had we moved, as far, Perchance, as arrow at three several flights Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down Descended Beatrice. With one voice All murmur'd "Adam"; circling next a plant Despoil'd of flowers and leaf, on every bough, Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose, Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds, for height, The Indians might have gazed at. "Blessed thou, Gryphon!2 whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite Was warp'd to evil." Round the stately trunk Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom rcturn'd The animal twice-gender'd: "Yea! for so The generation of the just are saved." And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot He drew it of the widow'd branch, and bound There, left unto the stock whereon it grew.</p>

Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose. I understood it not, nor to the end Endured the harmony.

<p>11 "With his feathers lined." In allusion to the donations made by Constantine to the Church.</p>

<p>12 "A dragon." Probably Mohammed; for what Lombardi offers to the contrary is far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>To profit the misguided world, keep now Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest, Take heed thou write, returning to that place."*</p>

<p>Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclined Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes I, as she bade, directed. Never fire, With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud Leap'd downward from the welkin's farthest bound, As I beheld the bird of Jove9 descend Down through the tree; and, as he rush'd, the rind Disparting crush beneath him; buds much more, And leaflets. On the car, with all his might He struck; whence, staggering, like a ship it reel'd, At random driven, to starboard now, o'ercome, And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves.</p>

<p>Next, springing up into the chariot's womb, A fox10 I saw, with hunger seeming pined Of all good food. But, for his ugly sins The saindy maid rebuking him, away Scampering he turn'd, fast as his hide-bound corpse Would bear him. Next, from whence before he came, I saw the eagle dart into the hull O' the car, and leave it with his feathers lined:11 And then a voice, like that which issues forth From heart with sorrow rived, did issue forth From Heaven, and "O poor bark of mine!" it cried, "How badly art thou freighted." Then it seem'd That the earth open'd, between either wheel; And I beheld a dragon12 issue thence, That through the chariot fix'd his forked train; And like a wasp, that draggeth back the sting, So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg'd Part of the bottom forth; and went his way, Exulting. What remain'd, as lively turf</p>

<p>As't were that none might bear her off, I saw</p>

<p>They mingled kisses. But, her lustful eyes</p>

<p>Shielded the harlot and the new-form'd brute.</p>

<p>11 "With plumes." The increase of wealth and temporal dominion, which followed the supposed gift of Constantine.</p>

<p>14 "Heads." By the seven heads, it is supposed with sufficient probability, are meant the seven capital sins: by the three with two horns, pride, anger, and avarice, injurious both to man himself and to his neighbor: by the four with one horn, gluttony, gloominess, concupiscence, and</p>

<p>envy, hurtful, at least in their primary effects, chiefly to him who is guilty of them.</p>

Lastly, the whole band arrive at the fountain, from whence the two streams, Lethe and Eunoc, separating, flow different ways; and Matilda, at the desire of Beatrice, causes our Poet to drink of the latter stream.</p>

<p>\HE heathen,1 Lord! are come:" responsive thus, I     The trinal now, and now the virgin band F    Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began, Weeping; and Beatrice listen'd, sad And sighing, to the song, in such a mood, That Mary, as she stood beside the Cross, Was scarce more changed. But when they gave her place To speak, then, risen upright on her feet, She, with a colour glowing bright as fire, Did answer: "Yet a little while,1 and ye Shall see me not; and, my beloved sistersl Again a little while, and ye shall see me."</p>

<p>Before her then she marshal'd all the seven; And, beckoning only, motion'd me, the dame, And that remaining sage,3 to follow her.</p>

<p>So on she pass'd; and had not set, I ween, Her tenth step to the ground, when, with mine eyes Her eyes encountered; and, with visage mild, "So mend thy pace," she cried, "that if my words Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly placed To hear them." Soon as duly to her side I now had hasten'd: "Brother!" she began, "Why makest thou no attempt at questioning, As thus we walk together?" Like to those Who, speaking with too reverent an awe Before their betters, draw not forth the voice Alive unto their lips, befel me then That I in sounds imperfect thus began: "Lady! what I have need of, that thou know'st; And what will suit my need."

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto i</p>

<p>Will fit me. If but seldom, mighty Sire! To grace his triumph, gathers thence a wreath Caesar, or bard, (more shame for human wills Depraved), joy to the Delphic god must spring From the Peneian foliage, when one breast Is with such thirst inspired. From a small spark Great flame hath risen: after me, perchance, Others with better voice may pray, and gain, From the Cyrrhaean city, answer kind.</p>

<p>Through divers passages, the world's bright lamp Rises to mortals; but through that3 which joins Four circles with the threefold cross, in best Course, and in happiest constellation4 set, He comes; and, to the worldly wax, best gives Its temper and impression. Morning there,' Here eve was well-nigh by such passage made; And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere, Blackness the other part; when to the left* I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken. As from the first a second beam is wont To issue, and reflected upward rise, Even as a pilgrim bent on his return; So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd Into my fancy, mine was form'd: and straight, Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes Upon the sun. Much is allow'd us there, That here exceeds our power; thanks to the place Made for the dwelling of the human kind.</p>

<p>I sufler'd it not long; and yet so long, That I beheld it bickering sparks around, As iron that comes boiling from the fire. And suddenly upon the day appcar'd A day new-risen; as he, who hath the power,</p>

<p>* "Where the four circles, the horizon, the zodiac, the equator, and the equinoctial colurc join; the last three intersecting each other so as to form three crosses, as may be seen in the armillary sphere."</p>

<p>* Aries. Some understand the planet Venus by the "migliore Stella."</p>

<p>5 "Morning there." It was morning where he then was, and about eventide on the earth.</p>

<p>6 "To the left." Being in the opposite hemisphere to ours, Beatrice, that she may behold the rising sun, turns herself to the left.</p>

<p>canto i PARADISE 287</p>

<p>Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.</p>

<p>Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels, Beatrice stood unmoved; and I with ken Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze removed, At her aspect, such inwardly became As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb That made him peer among the ocean gods: Words may not tell of that trans-human change; And therefore let the example serve, though weak, For those whom grace hath better proof in store.</p>

<p>If I were only what thou didst create, Then newly, Love! by whom the Heaven is ruled; Thou know'st, who by Thy light didst bear me up. Whcnas the wheel which Thou dost ever guide, Desired Spirit! with its harmony, Temper'd of Thee and measured, charm'd mine ear, Then seem'd to me so much of Heaven to blaze With the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made A lake so broad. The newness of the sound, And that great light, inflamed me with desire, Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.</p>

<p>Whence she, who saw me, clearly as myself, To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd, Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began: "With false imagination thou thyself Makest dull; so that thou seest not the thing, Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off. Thou art not on the earth as thou believest; For lightning, scaped from its own proper place, Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd."</p>

<p>Although divested of my first-raised doubt By those brief words accompanied with smiles, Yet in new doubt was I entangled more, And said: "Already satisfied, I rest From admiration deep; but now admire How I above those lighter bodies rise."</p>

<p>Whence, after utterance of a piteous sigh, She toward me bent her eyes, with such a look, As on her frenzied child a mother casts; Then thus began: "Among themselves all things</p>

<p>Some less approaching to their primal source.</p>

<p>Thus they to different havens are moved on</p>

<p>Through the vast sea of being, and each one</p>

<p>With instinct given, that bears it in its course:</p>

<p>That as, oft-times, but ill accords the form</p>

<p>To the design of art, through sluggishness</p>

<p>Or unreplying matter; so this course</p>

<p>Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who</p>

<p>Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;</p>

The way I pass, Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale; Apollo guides me; and another Nine, To my rapt sight, the arctic beams reveal. Ye other few who have outstretch'd the neck Timely for food of angels, on which here They live, yet never know satiety; Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out Your vessel; marking well the furrow broad Before you in the wave, that on both sides Equal returns. Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er To Colchis, wonder'd not as ye will do, When they saw Jason following the plough.</p>

<p>Beatrice upward gazed, and I on her; And in such space as on the notch a dart Is placed, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself Arrived, where wonderous thing engaged my sight. Whence she, to whom no care of mine was hid, Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair, Bespake me: "Gratefully direct thy mind To God, through whom to this first star1 we come."</p>

<p>Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,</p>

<p>Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smit.</p>

<p>Within itself the ever-during pearl</p>

<p>Received us; as the wave a ray of light</p>

<p>Receives, and rests unbroken. If I then</p>

<p>Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend</p>

<p>Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus</p>

<p>Another could endure, which needs must be</p>

<p>If body enter body; how much more</p>

<p>Must the desire inflame us to behold</p>

<p>That Essence, which discovers by what means</p>

<p>God and our nature join'dl There will be seen</p>

<p>That, which we hold through faith; not shown by proof,</p>

<p>But in itself intelligibly plain,</p>

<p>E'en as the truth that man at first believes.</p>

<p>I answer'd: "Lady! I with thoughts devout, Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him, Who hath removed me from the mortal world. But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots Upon this body, which below on earth Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?"</p>

<p>She somewhat smiled, then spake: "If mortals err In their opinion, when the key of sense Unlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen Ought not to pierce thee: since thou find'st, the wings Of reason to pursue the senses' flight Are short. But what thy own thought is, declare."</p>

<p>Then I: "What various here above appears, Is caused, I deem, by bodies dense or rare."</p>

<p>She then resumed: "Thou certainly wilt see In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well Thou listen to the arguments which I Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays Numberless lights, the which, in kind and size, May be remark'd of different aspects: If rare or dense of that were cause alone, One single virtue then would be in all; Alike distributed, or more, or less. Different virtues needs must be the fruits Of formal principles; and these, save one,</p>

<p>Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd. Beside,</p>

<p>If rarity were of that dusk the cause,</p>

<p>Which thou inquirest, either in some part</p>

<p>That planet must throughout be void, nor fed</p>

<p>With its own matter; or, as bodies share</p>

<p>Their fat and leanness, in like manner this</p>

<p>Must in its volume change the leaves.2 The first,</p>

<p>If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse</p>

<p>Been manifested, by transparency</p>

<p>Of light, as through aught rare beside effused.</p>

<p>But this is not. Therefore remains to see</p>

<p>The other cause: and, if the other fall,</p>

<p>Erroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee.</p>

<p>If not from side to side this rarity</p>

<p>Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence</p>

<p>Its contrary no further lets it pass.</p>

<p>And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,</p>

<p>Must be pour'd back; as colour comes, through glass</p>

<p>Reflected, which behind it lead conceals.</p>

<p>Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue,</p>

<p>Than, in the other part, the ray is shown,</p>

<p>Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes:</p>

<p>Then turn'd toward them, cause behind thy back</p>

<p>A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,</p>

<p>And thus reflected come to thee from all.</p>

<p>Though that, beheld most distant, do not stretch</p>

<p>A space so ample, yet in brightness thou</p>

<p>Wilt own it equaling the rest. But now,</p>

<p>As under snow the ground, if the warm ray</p>

<p>And cold, that cover'd it before; so thee,</p>

<p>Shall quiver where it falls. Within the Heaven,'</p>

<p>Where peace divine inhabits, circles round</p>

<p>A body, in whose virtue lies the being</p>

<p>Of all that it contains. The following Heaven,</p>

<p>That hath so many lights, this being divides,</p>

<p>Through different essences, from it distinct,</p>

<p>And yet contain'd within it. The other orbs</p>

<p>Their separate distinctions variously</p>

<p>Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt.</p>

<p>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,</p>

<p>As thou beholdest now, from step to step;</p>

<p>Their influences from above deriving,</p>

<p>And thence transmitting downward. Mark me well;</p>

<p>How through this passage to the truth I ford,</p>

<p>The truth thou lovest; that thou henceforth, alone,</p>

<p>Mayst know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.</p>

<p>"The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs, As mallet by the workman's hand, must needs By blessed movers4 be inspired. This Heaven,5 Made beauteous by so many luminaries, From the deep spirit,8 that moves its circling sphere, Its image takes and impress as a seal: And as the soul, that dwells within your dust, Through members different, yet together form'd, In different powers resolves itself; e'en so The intellectual efficacy unfolds Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars; On its own unity revolving still. Different virtue7 compact different Makes with the precious body it enlivens, With which it knits, as life in you is knit.</p>

<p>* According to our Poet's system, there are ten Heavens. The Heaven, "where peace divine inhabits," is the empyrean; the body within it, that "circles round," is the primtim mobile; "the following Heaven," that of the fixed stars; and "the other orbs," the seven lower Heavens, are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. Thus Milton, "Paradise Lost" b. iii. 481.</p>

<p>4 "By blessed movers." By Angels.</p>

<p>5 "This Heaven." The Heaven of fixed stars.</p>

<p>6 "The deep spirit" The moving Angel.</p>

<p>canto hi PARADISE 293</p>

<p>From its original nature full of joy,</p>

<p>The virtue mingled through the body shines,</p>

<p>As joy through pupil of the living eye.</p>

<p>From hence proceeds that which from light to light</p>

<p>Seems different, and not from dense or rare.</p>

<p>This is the formal cause, that generates,</p>

<p>Proportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear."</p>

<p>CANTO III</p>

<p>Argument.In the moon Dante meets with Piccarda, the sister of Forese, who tells him that this planet is allotted to those, who, after having made profession of chastity and a religious life, had been compelled to violate their vows; and she then poults out to him the spirit of the Empress Costanza.</p>

<p>THAT sun,1 which erst with love my bosom warmed, Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect, By proof of right, and of the false reproof; And I, to own myself convinced and free Of doubt, as much as needed, raised my head Erect for speech. But soon a sight appear'd, Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd That of confession I no longer thought.</p>

<p>As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave Clear and unmoved, and flowing not so deep As that its bed is dark, the shape returns So faint of our impictured lineaments, That, on white forehead set, a pearl as strong Comes to the eye; such saw I many a face, All stretch'd to speak; from whence I straight conceived, Delusion2 opposite to that, which raised, Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.</p>

<p>Sudden, as I perceived them, deeming these Reflected semblances, to see of whom They were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw; Then turn'd them back, directed on the light Of my sweet guide, who, smiling, shot forth beams From her celestial eyes. "Wonder not thou,"</p>

<p>1 "That sun." Beatrice. a shadow for a substance; I, a substance</p>

<p>1 "Delusion."  "An error the contrary    for a shadow." to that of Narcissus; because he mistook</p>

<p>294</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto iii</p>

<p>She cried, "at this my smiling, when I see Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont, Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy. True substances are these, which thou behold'st, Hither through failure of their vow exiled. But speak thou with them; listen, and believe, That the true light, which fills them with desire, Permits not from its beams their feet to stray."</p>

<p>Straight to the shadow, which for converse seem'd Most earnest, I address'd me; and began As one by over-eagerness perplex'd: "O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays Of life eternal, of that sweetness know'st The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far All apprehension; me it well would please, If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this Your station here." Whence she with kindness prompt And eyes glist'ring with smiles: "Our charity, To any wish by justice introduced, Bars not the door; no more than She above, Who would have all her court be like herself. I was a virgin sister in the earth; And if thy mind observe me well, this form, With such addition graced of loveliness, Will not conceal me long; but thou wilt know Piccarda,' in the tardiest sphere thus placed, Here 'mid these other blessed also blest. Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone With pleasure from the Holy Spirit conceived, Admitted to His order, dwell in joy. And this condition, which appears so low, Is for this cause assign'd us, that our vows Were, in some part, neglected and made void."</p>

<p>Whence I to her replied: "Something divine Beams in your countenances wondrous fair; From former knowledge quite transmuting you.</p>

<p>' "Piccarda." The sister of Corso Petrarch has been supposed to allude to Donati, and of Forese, whom we have this lady in his "Triumph of Chastity," seen   in  the  Purgatory,   Canto  xxiv.    v. 160, etc.</p>

<p>canto iii</p>

<p>PARADISE</p>

<p>295</p>

<p>Therefore to recollect was I so slow. But what thou say'st hath to my memory Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms Is easier. Yet inform me, ye, who here Are happy; long ye for a higher place, More to behold, and more in love to dwell?"</p>

<p>She with those other spirits gently smiled; Then answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'd With love's first flame to glow: "Brother! our will Is, in composure, setded by the power Of charity, who makes us will alone What we possess, and naught beyond desire: If we should wish to be exalted more, Then must our wishes jar with the high will Of Him, who sets us here; which in these orbs Thou wilt confess not possible, if here To be in charity must needs befall, And if her nature well thou contemplate. Rather it is inherent in this state Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within The Divine Will, by which our wills with His Are one. So that as we, from step to step, Are placed throughout this kingdom, pleases all, Even as our King, who in us plants His will; And in His will is our tranquillity: It is the mighty ocean, whither tends Whatever it creates and Nature makes."</p>

<p>Then saw I clearly how each spot in Heaven 1  Paradise, though with like gracious dew The supreme virtue shower not over all.</p>

<p>But as it chances, if one sort of food Hath satiated, and of another still The appetite remains, that this is ask'd, And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I, In word and motion, bent from her to learn What web it was,4 through which she had not drawn The shuttle to its point. She thus began: "Exalted worth and perfectness of life</p>

<p>'What vow of religious life it was that she had been hindered from completing,</p>

<p>had been compelled to break."</p>

Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt, Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale. God knows8 how, after that, my life was framed. This other splendid shape, which thou bchold'st At my right side, burning with all the light Of this our orb, what of myself I tell May to herself apply. From her, like me A sister, with like violence were torn The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.

Before the spouse of Christ came together with her new husband, she knelt down before a crucifix and recommended her virginity to Christ. Soon after her whole</p>

<p>body was smitten with leprosy; in a few days, through the divine disposal, she passed with a palm of virginity to the Lord.</p>

She was fiftv years old or more at the time, and "because it was not credited that she could have a child at that age, she was delivered in a pavilion, and it was given out that any lady, who pleased, was at liberty to see her."</p>

<p>CANTO IV</p>

<p>Argument.While they still continue in the moon, Beatrice removes certain doubts which Dante had conceived respecting the place assigned to the blessed, and respecting the will absolute or conditional. He inquires whether it is possible to make satisfaction for a vow broken.</p>

<p>BETWEEN two kinds of food, both equally Remote and tempting, first a man might die Of hunger, ere he one could freely chuse. E'en so would stand a lamb between the maw Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike: E'en so between two deer a dog would stand. Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise I to myself impute; by equal doubts Held in suspense; since of necessity It happen'd. Silent was I, yet desire Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake My wish more earnestly than language could.</p>

<p>As Daniel,1 when the haughty king he freed From ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust And violent; so did Beatrice then.</p>

<p>"Well I discern," she thus her words address'd, "How thou art drawn by each of these desires;1 So that thy anxious thought is in itself Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth. Thou arguest: if the good intent remain; What reason that another's violence</p>

<p>Another question thwarts thee, which, to solve, Might try thy patience without better aid. I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind, That blessed spirit may not lie; since near The source of primal truth it dwells for aye: And thou mightst after of Piccarda learn That Constance held affection to the veil; So that she seems to contradict me here. Not seldom, brother, it hath chanced for men To do what they had gladly left undone; Yet, to shun peril, they have done amiss: E'en as Alcmxon, at his father's" suit Slew his own mother;12 so made pitiless, Not to lose pity. On this point bethink thee, That force and will are blended in such wise As not to make the offence excusable. Absolute will agrees not to the wrong; But inasmuch as there is fear of woe From non-compliance, it agrees. Of will1* Thus absolute, Piccarda spake, and I Of the other; so that both have truly said."</p>

<p>Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd From forth the fountain of all truth; and such The rest, that to my wandering thoughts I found.</p>

<p>"O thou, of primal love the prime delight, Goddess!" I straight replied, "whose lively words Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul; Affection fails me to requite thy grace With equal sum of gratitude: be His To recompense, who sees and can reward thee. Well I discern, that by that Truth14 alone Enlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam, Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know: Therein she resteth, e'en as in his lair The wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound. And she hath power to reach it; else desire</p>

<p>The light of divine truth.</p>

<p>canto v PARADISE 301</p>

<p>CANTO V</p>

<p>Argument.The question proposed in the last Canto is answered. Dante ascends with Beatrice to the planet Mercury, which is the second heaven; and here he finds a multitude of spirits, one of whom offers to satisfy him of anything he may desire to know from them.</p>

<p>" TT F beyond earthly wont,1 the flame of love I   Illume me, so that I o'ercome thy power M   Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause In that perfection of the sight, which, soon As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach The good it apprehends. I well discern, How in thine intellect already shines The light eternal, which to view alone Ne'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else Your love seduces, 'tis but that it shows Some ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam.</p>

<p>"This wouldst thou know: if failure of the vow By other service may be so supplied, As from self-question to assure the soul."</p>

<p>Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish, Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off</p>

<p>1 'If beyond earthly wont." Dante having been unable to sustain the splendor of Beatrice, as we have seen at the end</p>

<p>of the last Canto, she tells him to attribute her increase of brightness to the place in which they were.</p>

<p>Were given to no end. And thence doth doubt</p>

<p>Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;</p>

<p>And it is nature which, from height to height,</p>

<p>On to the summit prompts us. This invites,</p>

<p>This doth assure me, Lady! reverently</p>

<p>To ask thee of another truth, that yet</p>

<p>Is dark to me. I fain would know, if man</p>

<p>By other works well done may so supply</p>

<p>The failure of his vows, that in your scale</p>

<p>They lack not weight." I spake; and on me straight</p>

<p>Beatrice look'd, with eyes that shot forth sparks</p>

<p>Of love celestial, in such copious stream,</p>

<p>That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,</p>

<p>I turn'd; and downward bent, confused, my sight.</p>

<p>Discourse, continued in her saintly strain. "Supreme of gifts,2 which God, creating, gave Of His free bounty, sign most evident Of goodness, and in His account most prized Was liberty of will; the boon, wherewith All intellectual creatures, and them sole, He hath endow'd. Hence now thou mayst infer Of what high worth the vow, which so is framed That when man offers, God well-pleased accepts: For in the compact between God and him, This treasure, such as I describe it to thee, He makes the victim; and of his own act. What compensation therefore may he find? If that, whereof thou hast oblation made, By using well thou think'st to consecrate, Thou wouldst of theft do charitable deed. Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.</p>

<p>"But forasmuch as holy Church, herein Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth I have discover'd to thee, yet behoves Thou rest a little longer at the board, Ere the crude aliment which thou hast ta'en, Digested fitly, to nutrition turn.

<p>To dally with itself in idle play."</p>

<p>Such were the words that Beatrice spake: These ended, to that region, where the world Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd.</p>

<p>Though mainly prompt new question to propose, Her silence and changed look did keep me dumb. And as the arrow, ere the cord is still, Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped Into the second realm. There I beheld The dame, so joyous, enter, that the orb Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star Were moved to gladness, what then was my cheer, Whom nature hath made apt for every change!</p>

<p>As in a quiet and clear lake the fish, If aught approach them from without, do draw Toward it, deeming it their food; so drew Full more than thousand splendours toward us; And in each one was heard: "Lo! one arrived To multiply our loves!" and as each came, The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new, Witness'd augmented joy. Here, Reader! think, If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale, To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave; And thou shalt see what vehement desire Possess'd me, soon as these had met my view, To know their state. "O born in happy hour! Thou, to whom grace vouchsafes, or e'er thy close Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones Of that eternal triumph; know, to us The light communicated, which through Heaven Expatiates without bound. Therefore, if aught Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid, Spare not; and, of our radiance, take thy fill."</p>

<p>Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me; And Beatrice next: "Say on; and trust As unto gods.""How in the light supreme Thou harbour'st, and from thence the virtue bring'st, That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy, I mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek; Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot</p>

<p>Argument.The spirit, who had offered to satisfy the inquiries of Dante, declares himself to be the Emperor Justinian; and after speaking of his own actions, recounts the victories, before him, obtained under the Roman Eagle.

<p>"This little star is furnish'd with good spirits, Whose mortal lives were busied to that end, That honour and renown might wait on them: And, when desires" thus err in their intention, True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.

Four daughters27 were there born To Raymond Berenger; and every one Became a queen: and this for him did Romeo, Though of mean state and from a foreign land.</p>

<p>24 "Charles." The commentators explain this to mean Charles II, King of Naples and Sicily.

<p>27 Of the four daughters of Raymond, Margaret, the eldest, was married to Louis IX of France; Eleanor to Henry III of England; Sancha to Richard, Henry's brother, and King of the Romans; and the youngest, Beatrix, to Charles I, King of Naples and Sicily, and brother to Louis.</p>

<p>Argument.In consequence of what had been said by Justinian, who together with the other spirits has now disappeared, some doubts arise in the mind of Dante respecting the human redemption. These difficulties are fully explained by Beatrice.</p>

<p>6 The punishment of Christ by the Jews, although just as far as regarded the human nature assumed by Him, and so a righteous vengeance of sin, yet being unjust as regards the divine nature, was itself justly revenged on the Jews by the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>'The Poet, on his arrival at the third Heaven, tells us that the world, in its days of heathen darkness, believed the influence of sensual love to proceed from the star, to which, under the name of</p>

<p>Venus, they paid divine honors; as they worshipped the supposed mother and son of Venus, under the names of Dione and Cupid.</p>

<p>In their whole being. But the elements,</p>

<p>Which thou hast named, and what of them is made,</p>

<p>Immediate, and enamours of itself;</p>

<p>So that our wishes rest for ever here.</p>

<p>"And hence thou mayst by inference conclude Our resurrection certain, if thy mind Consider how the human flesh was framed, When both our parents at the first were made."</p>

<p>THE world1 was, in its day of peril dark, Wont to believe the dotage of fond love, From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls In her third epicycle, shed on men By stream of potent radiance: therefore they Of elder time, in their old error blind, Not her alone with sacrifice adored And invocation, but like honours paid To Cupid and Dione, deem'd of them Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign'd To sit in Dido's bosom: and from her, Whom I have sung preluding, borrow'd they The appellation of that star, which views</p>

<p>I was not ware that I was wafted up Into its orb; but the new loveliness, That graced my lady, gave me ample proof That we had enter'd there. And as in flame A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice Discern'd, when one its even tenour keeps, The other comes and goes; so in that light I other luminaries saw, that coursed In circling motion, rapid more or less, As their eternal vision each impels.</p>

<p>Never was blast from vapour charged with cold, Whether invisible to eye or no, Descended with such speed, it had not seem'd To linger in dull tardiness, compared To those celestial lights, that toward us came, Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring, Conducted by the lofty Seraphim. And after them, who in the van appear'd, Such an Hosanna sounded as hath left Desire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hear Renew'd the strain. Then, parting from the rest, One near us drew, and sole began: "We all Are ready at thy pleasure, well disposed To do thee gentle service. We are they To whom thou in the world erewhile didst sing; 'O yel whose intellectual ministry Moves the third Heaven:' and in one orb we roll, One motion, one impulse, with those who rule Princedoms in Heaven; yet are of love so full, That to please thee 'twill be as sweet to rest."</p>

<p>After mine eyes had with meek reverence Sought the celestial guide, and were by her Assured, they turn'd again unto the light, Who had so largely promised; and with voice That bare the lively pressure of my zeal, "Tell who ye are," I cried.

Charles Martel then reminds him that he had learned from Aristotle that human society requires a variety of conditions, and consequently a variety of qualifications in its members. Accordingly, men are born with different powers and capacities, caused by the influence of the heavenly bodies at the time of their nativity; on which influence, and not on their parents, those powers and capacities depend. Charles Martel adds, by way of corollary, that the want of observing their n.itural bent, in the destination of men to their several offices in life, is the occasion of much of the disorder that prevails in the world.</p>

These, alike ignorant of theology and philosophy, relying wholly on their decretals (which I indeed esteem not unworthy of reverence), in the hope I suppose of obtaining for them a paramount influence, derogate from the authority of the empire. Nor is this to be wondered at, when I have heard one of them impudently maintaining, that traditions are the foundation of the faith of the Church."</p>

<p>Never was heart in such devotion bound, And with complacency so absolute Disposed to render up itself to God, As mine was at those words: and so entire The love for Him, that held me, it eclipsed Beatrice in oblivion.

<p>14 Albertus Magnus was born at Laugin-gen, in Thuringia, in 1193. and studied at Paris and at Padua; at the latter place he entered into the Dominican order. He then taught theology in various parts of Germany, and particularly at Cologne. Thomas Aquinas was his favorite pupil. In 1260 he reluctantly accepted the bishopric of Ratisbon, and in two years after resigned it, and returned to his cell in Cologne, where the remainder of his life was passed in superintending the school, and in composing his voluminous works on divinity and natural science. He died in 1280.</p>

<p>16 Thomas Aquinas, of whom Bucer is</p>

<p>reported to have said, "Take but Thomas away, and I will overturn the Church of Rome"; and whom Hooker terms "the greatest among the school divines" ("Ecd. Pol." b. iii.  9), was born of noble parents, who anxiously but vainly endeavored to divert him from a life of celibacy and study. He died in 1274, at the age of forty-seven.</p>

With a recommendation from the Bishop of Lucca to St. Bernard, he went into France to continue his studies; and for that purpose remained some time at Rheims, whence he proceeded to Paris. Here his reputation was so great that Philip, brother of Louis VII, being chosen Bishop of Paris, resigned that dignity to Pietro, whose pupil he had been. He held his bishopric only one year, and died 1160. His "Liber Sententiarum" is highly esteemed. It contains a system of scholastic theology, much more complete than any which had been yet seen.</p>

<p>CANTO XII</p>

<p>Argument.A second circle of glorified souls encompasses the first. Buonaventura, who is one of them, celebrates the praises of St. Dominic, and informs Dante who the other eleven are, that are in this second circle or garland.</p>

<p>SOON as its final word the blessed flame' Had raised for utterance, straight the holy mill1 Began to wheel; nor yet had once revolved, Or e'er another, circling, compass'd it, Motion to motion, song to song, conjoining; Song, that as much our muses doth excel, Our Syrens with their tuneful pipes, as ray Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex.</p>

<p>As when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth, Two arches parallel, and trick'd alike, Span the thin cloud, the outer taking birth From that within (in manner of that voice' Whom love did melt away, as sun the mist), And they who gaze, presageful call to mind The compact, made with Noah, of the world No more to be o'erflow'd; about us thus, Of sempiternal roses, bending, wreathed Those garlands twain; and to the innermost E'en thus the external answer'd. When the footing, And other great festivity, of song, And radiance, light with light accordant, each Jocund and blythe, had at their pleasure still'd, (E'en as the eyes, by quick volition moved, Are shut and raised together), from the heart Of one4 amongst the new lights5 moved a voice,</p>

<p>2 The circle of spirits.</p>

<p>3 One rainbow giving back the image of the other, as sound is reflected by Echo, that nymph, who was melted away by her fondness for Narcissus, as vapor is melted by the sun. The reader will observe in the text not only a second and third simile within the first, but two mythological and one sacred allusion bound up together with the whole. Even after this accumulation of imagery, the two circles of spirits, by whom Beatrice</p>

<p>and Dante were encompassed, are by a bold figure termed two garlands of never-fading roses.</p>

<p>4 "One." St. Buonaventura, general of the Franciscan order, in which he effected some reformation; and one of the most profound divines of his age. "He refused the archbishopric of York, which was offered him by Clement IV, but afterward was prevailed on to accept the bishopric of Albano and a cardinal's hat. He was born at Bagnoregio or Bagnorea, in Tuscany, A. D. 1221, and died in</p>

<p>Began: "The love,7 that makes me beautiful,</p>

<p>Prompts me to tell of the other guide, for whom</p>

<p>Such good of mine is spoken.  Where one is,</p>

<p>The other worthily should also be;</p>

<p>That as their warfare was alike, alike</p>

<p>Should be their glory.  Slow, and full of doubt,</p>

<p>And with thin ranks, after its banner moved</p>

<p>The army of Christ, (which it so dearly cost</p>

<p>To reappoint), when its imperial Head</p>

<p>Who reigneth ever, for the drooping host</p>

<p>Did make provision, through grace alone,</p>

<p>And not through its deserving.  As thou heard'st,*</p>

<p>Two champions to the succour of His spouse</p>

<p>He sent, who by their deeds and words might join</p>

<p>Again His scatter'd people.   In that clime*</p>

<p>Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold</p>

<p>The fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself</p>

<p>New-garmented; nor from those billows10 far,</p>

<p>Beyond whose chiding, after weary course,</p>

<p>The sun doth sometimes11 hide him; safe abides</p>

<p>The happy Callaroga,12 under guard</p>

<p>Of the great shield, wherein the lion lies</p>

<p>Subjected and supreme.   And there was born</p>

<p>The loving minion of the Christian faith,1'</p>

<p>5 In the circle that had newly surrounded the first.</p>

<p>" That made me turn to it, as the needle does to the pole."</p>

<p>7 "The love." By an act of mutual courtesy, Buonaventura, a Franciscan, is made to proclaim the praises of St. Dominic, as Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican, has celebrated those of St. Francis; and in like manner each blames the irregularities, not of the other's order, but of that to which himself belonged. Even Mac-chiavelli, no great friend to the Church, attributes the revival of Christianity to the influence of these two saints.</p>

<p>See the last Canto, v. 33.</p>

<p>9 "In that clime."  Spain.</p>

<p>10 "Those billows."   The Atlantic.</p>

<p>11 During the summer solstice.</p>

<p>12 "Callaroga." Between Osma and Aranda, in Old Castile designated by the royal coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>13 Dominic was born April 5, 1170, and died August 6, 1221. His birthplace Callaroga; his father and mother's names. Felix, and Joanna; his mother's dream; his name of Dominic, given him in consequence of a vision by his godmother, are all told in an anonymous life of the saint, said to have been written in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xii</p>

<p>14 His mother, when pregnant with him, is said to have dreamt that she should bring forth a white and black dog with a lighted torch in his mouth, which were signs of the habit to be worn by his order, and of his fervent zeal.</p>

<p>15 His godmother's dream was, that he had one star in his forehead and another in the nape of his neck, from which he communicated light to the east and the west.</p>

<p>" "Jesus said unto him. If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me."Matt. xix. ai. Dominic is said to have followed this advice.</p>

<p>17 His nurse, when she returned to him, often found that he had left his bed, and was prostrate, and in prayer.</p>

<p>18 "Felix."   Felix Gusman.</p>

<p>" Grace or gift of the Lord.</p>

<p>20 Arrigo (about 1250 A. D.), a native of Susa, and cardinal of Ostia and Vclletri, hence his name of Ostiense, was celebrated for his lectures on the Decretals.</p>

<p>21 "Taddeo." Either the physician or the lawyer of that name. The former, T. d' Aldcrotto, a Florentine, called the Hippocratean, translated the Ethics of Aristotle into Latin; and died toward the end of the thirteenth century. The other, of Bologna, left no writings behind him.</p>

<p>And to his enemies terrible.  So replete</p>

<p>His soul with lively virtue, that when first</p>

<p>Created, even in the mother's womb,14</p>

<p>It prophesied. When, at the sacred font,</p>

<p>The spousals were complete 'twixt faith and him,</p>

<p>Where pledge of mutual safety was exchanged,</p>

<p>The dame,15 who was his surety, in her sleep</p>

<p>Beheld the wondrous fruit, that was from him</p>

<p>And from his heirs to issue.  And that such</p>

<p>He might be construed, as indeed he was,</p>

<p>She was inspired to name him of his owner,</p>

<p>Whose he was wholly; and so call'd him Dominic.</p>

<p>And I speak of him, as the labourer,</p>

<p>Whom Christ in His own garden chose to be</p>

<p>His help-mate.   Messenger he seem'd, and friend</p>

<p>Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show'd,</p>

<p>Was after the first counsel16 that Christ gave.</p>

<p>Many a time17 his nurse, at entering, found</p>

<p>That he had risen in silence, and was prostrate,</p>

<p>As who should say, 'My errand was for this.'</p>

<p>O happy father! Felix18 rightly named.</p>

<p>O favour'd mother! rightly named Joanna;</p>

<p>If that do mean, as men interpret it."</p>

<p>Not for the world's sake, for which now they toil</p>

<p>Upon Ostiense20 and Taddeo's11 lore;</p>

<p>But for the real manna, soon he grew</p>

<p>Mighty in learning; and did set himself</p>

<p>To go about the vineyard, that soon turns</p>

<p>To wan and wither'd, if not tended well:</p>

<p>And from the see22 (whose bounty to the just</p>

<p>And needy is gone by, not through its fault,</p>

<p>But his who fills it basely), he besought,</p>

<p>No dispensation2' for commuted wrong,</p>

<p>Nor the first vacant fortune,24 nor the tenths</p>

<p>That to God's paupers rightly appertain,</p>

<p>But, 'gainst an erring and degenerate world,</p>

<p>License to fight, in favour of that seed25</p>

<p>From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.</p>

<p>Then, with sage doctrine and good will to help,</p>

<p>Forth on his great apostleship he fared,</p>

<p>Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein;</p>

<p>And, dashing 'gainst the stocks of heresy,</p>

<p>Smote fiercest, where resistance was most stout.</p>

<p>Thence many rivulets have since been turn'd,</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xii</p>

<p>** "I question not." "Some indeed might be found, who still observe the rule of the order; but such would come neither from Casale nor Acquasparta." At Casale, in Monferr.it, the discipline had been enforced by Uberto with unnecessary rigor; and at Acquasparta, in the territory of Todi, it had been equally relaxed by the Cardinal Matteo, general of the order.</p>

<p>31 Two among the earliest followers of St. Francis.</p>

<p>*2 "Hugues of Saint Victor." He was of the monastery of St. Victor at Paris, and died in 1142, at the age of forty-four. His ten books, illustrative of the celestial hierarchy of Dionysius the Areopagite, according to the translation of Joannes Scotus, are inscribed to King Louis, son of Louis le Gros, by whom the monastery had been founded.</p>

<p>33 "Pietro Mangiadore." Petrus Comes-tor, or the Eater, born at Troyes, was canon and dean of that church, and afterward chancellor of the church of Paris. He relinquished these benefices to become a regular canon of St. Victor at Paris, where he died in 1198.</p>

<p>'* To Pope Adrian V succeeded John XXI, a native of Lisbon; a man of great genius and extraordinary acquirements, especially in logic and in medicine, as his books, written in the name of Peter of Spain, (by which he was known before he became Pope), may testify. He was killed at Viterbo, by the falling in of the roof of his chamber, after he had been pontiff only eight months and as many days, A. D. 1277.</p>

<p>" "Chrysostom." The eloquent Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>

<p>36 Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Aosta, about 1034, and studied under Lanfranc, at the monastery of Bee in Normandy, where he afterward devoted himself to a religious life, in his twenty-seventh year. In three years he was made prior, and then abbot of that monastery; from whence he was taken, in 1093, to succeed to the archbishopric, vacant by the death of Lanfranc. He enjoyed this dignity till his death in 1109, though it was disturbed by many dissensions with William II and Henry 1 respecting immunities and investitures.</p>

<p>Admittance to the barn. I question not10 But he, who search'd our volume, leaf by leaf, Might still find page with this inscription on't, 'I am as I was wont.'  Yet such were not From Acquasparta nor Casale, whence, Of those who come to meddle with the text, One stretches and another cramps its rule. Bonaventura's life in me behold, From Bagnoregio; one, who, in discharge Of my great offices, still laid aside All sinister aim.  Illuminato here, And Agostino" join me: two they were, Among the first of those barefooted meek ones, Who sought God's friendship in the cord: with them</p>

<p>Hugues of Saint Victor;*1 Pietro Mangiadore;33 And he of Spain" in his twelve volumes shining; Nathan the prophet; Metropolitan Chrysostom;*5 and Anselmo;** and, who deign'd To put his hand to the first art, Donatus.</p>

<p>CANTO XIII</p>

<p>Argument.Thomas Aquinas resumes his speech. He solves the other of those doubts which he discerned in the mind of Dante, and warns him earnesdy against assenting to any proposition without having duly examined it.</p>

<p>IET him,1 who would conceive what now I saw, Imagine, (and retain the image firm ^As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak,) Of stars, fifteen, from midst the ethereal host Selected that, with lively ray serene, O'ercome the massiest air: thereto imagine The wain, that, in the bosom of our sky, Spins ever on its axle night and day, With the bright summit of that horn, which swells Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls, To have ranged themselves in fashion of two signs In Heaven, such as Ariadne made, When death's chill seized her; and that one of them Did compass in the other's beam; and both In such sort whirl around, that each should tend With opposite motion; and, conceiving thus, Of that true constellation, and the dance Twofold, that circled me, he shall attain As 'twere the shadow; for things there as much Surpass our usage, as the swiftest Heaven Is swifter than the Chiana.1 There was sung</p>

<p>Three Persons in the Godhead, and in one</p>

<p>Person that nature and the human join'd.</p>

<p>The song and round were measured: and to US Those saindy lights attended, happier made At each new ministering. Then silence brake Amid the accordant sons of Deity, That luminary,* in which the wondrous life Of the meek man of God* was told to me; And thus it spake:  "One ear5 o' the harvest thresh'd, And its grain safely stored, sweet charity Invites me with the other to like toil.</p>

<p>"Thou know'st, that in the bosom,* whence the rib Was ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste All the world pays for; and in that, which pierced By the keen lance, both after and before Such satisfaction offer'd as outweighs Each evil in the scale; whate'er of light To human nature is allow'd, must all Have by His virtue been infused, who form'd Both one and other: and thou thence admirest In that I told thee, of beatitudes, A second there is none to him enclosed In the fifth radiance.  Open now thine eyes To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth, As centre in the round. That7 which dies not, And that which can die, are but each the beam Of that idea, which our Sovereign Sire Engendered! loving; for that lively light,*</p>

<p>Thomas Aquinas.</p>

<p>4 St. Francis. See Canto xL 25.</p>

<p>* "Having solved one of thy questions, I proceed to answer the other. Thou thinkest then that Adam and Christ were both endued with all the perfection of which the human nature is capable; and therefore wonderest at what has been said concerning Solomon."</p>

<p>* "Thou knowest that in the breast of Adam, whence the rib was taken to make that fair cheek of Eve, which, by tasting the apple, brought death into the world;</p>

<p>and also in the breast of Christ, which, being pierced by the lance, made satisfaction for the sins of the whole world; as much wisdom resided, as human nature was capable of: and thou dost therefore wonder that I should have spoken of Solomon as the wisest." See Canto x. 105.</p>

<p>' "That." Things, corruptible and incorruptible, are only emanations from the archetypal idea residing in the Divine Mind.</p>

<p>Which passeth from His splendour, not disjoin'd From Him, nor from His love triune with them,* Doth, through His bounty, congregate itself, Mirror'd, as 'twere, in new existences;10 Itself unalterable, and ever one.</p>

<p>"Descending hence unto the lowest powers,11 Its energy so sinks, at last it makes But brief contingencies; for so I name Things generated, which the heavenly orbs Moving, with seed or without seed, produce. Their wax, and that which moulds it,12 differ much: And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows The ideal stamp imprest: so that one tree, According to his kind, hath better fruit, And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men, Are in your talents various. Were the wax Moulded with nice exactness, and the heaven18 In its disposing influence supreme, The brightness of the seal14 should be complete: But nature renders it imperfect ever; Resembling thus the artist, in his work, Whose faltering hand is faithless to his skill. Therefore,15 if fervent Love dispose, and mark The lustrous Image of the primal Virtue, There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such The clay18 was made, accomplish'd with each gift, That life can teem with; such the burden fill'd The Virgin's bosom: so that I commend Thy judgment, that the human nature ne'er Was, or can be, such as in them it was.</p>

<p>"Did I advance no further than this point; 'How then had he no peer?' thou might'st reply. But, that what now appears not, may appear</p>

<p>*"His love triune with them." The Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>10 Angels and human souls.</p>

<p>11 Irrational life and brute matter.</p>

<p>11 "Their wax, and that which moulds it." Matter, and the virtue or energy that acts on it.</p>

<p>" "The heaven." The influence of the planetary bodies.</p>

<p>14 The brightness of the Divine idea before spoken of.</p>

<p>15 "Therefore." Daniello remarks that our Poet intends this for a brief description of the Trinity: the primal virtue signifying the Father; the lustrous image, the Son; the fervent love, the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what (When he was bidden 'Ask') the motive, sway'd To his requesting.  I have spoken thus, That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd" For wisdom, to the end he might be king Sufficient: not, the number to search out Of the celestial movers; or to know, If necessary with contingent e'er Have made necessity; or whether that Be granted, that first motion" is; or if, Of the mid-circle," can by art be made Triangle, with its corner blunt or sharp.</p>

<p>"Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this, Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn, At which the dart of my intention aims. And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,' Thou shalt discern it only hath respect To kings, of whom are many, and the good Are rare. With this distinction take my words; And they may well consist with that which thou Of the first human father dost believe, And of our well-beloved. And let this Henceforth be lead unto thy feet, to make Thee slow in motion, as a weary man, Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not. For he among the fools is down full low, Whose affirmation, or denial, is Without distinction, in each case alike.

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xiv</p>

<p>CANTO XIV</p>

<p>Argument.Solomon, who is one of the spirits in the inner circle, declares what the appearance of the blest will be after the resurrection of the body. Beatrice and Dante arc translated into the fifth heaven, which is that of Mars; and here behold the souls of those, who had died fighting for the true faith, ranged in the sign of the cross, athwart which the spirits move to the sound of a melodious hymn.</p>

<p>FROM centre to the circle, and so back From circle to the centre, water moves In the round chalice, even as the blow Impels it, inwardly, or from without. Such was the image1 glanced into my mind, As the great spirit of Aquinum ceased; And Beatrice, after him, her words Resumed alternate:  "Need there is (though yet He tells it to you not in words, nor e'en In thought) that he should fathom to its depth Another mystery.   Tell him, if the light, Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you Eternally, as now; and, if it doth, How, when2 ye shall regain your visible forms, The sight may without harm endure the change, That also tell." As those, who in a ring Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound; Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit, The saindy circles, in their tourneying And wondrous note, attested new delight.</p>

<p>Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live Immortally above; he hath not seen The sweet refreshing of that heavenly shower.'</p>

<p>Him, who lives ever, and forever reigns In mystic union of the three in one, Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice Sang, with such melody, as, but to hear, For highest merit were an ample meed.</p>

<p>1 The voice of Thomas Aquinas pro- 1 "When."   When ye shall be again</p>

<p>canto xiv</p>

<p>PARADISE</p>

<p>345</p>

<p>And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,4</p>

<p>With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps</p>

<p>The Angel's once to Mary, thus replied:</p>

<p>"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,</p>

<p>Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright</p>

<p>As fervent; fervent as, in vision, blest;</p>

<p>And that as far, in blessedness, exceeding,</p>

<p>As it hath grace, beyond its virtue, great.</p>

<p>Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds</p>

<p>Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,</p>

<p>Show yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase</p>

<p>Whate'er, of light, gratuitous imparts</p>

<p>The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,</p>

<p>The better to disclose His glory: whence,</p>

<p>The vision needs increasing, must increase</p>

<p>The fervour, which it kindles; and that too</p>

<p>The ray, that comes from it. But as the gleed</p>

<p>Which gives out flame, yet in its whiteness shines</p>

<p>More livelily than that, and so preserves</p>

<p>Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere</p>

<p>Of splendour shall to view less radiant seem,</p>

<p>Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth</p>

<p>Now covers. Nor will such excess of light</p>

<p>O'erpower us, in corporeal organs made</p>

<p>Firm, and susceptible of all delight."</p>

<p>So ready and so cordial an "Amen" Follow'd from either choir, as plainly spoke Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear, Mothers and sires, and those whom best they loved, Ere they were made imperishable flame.</p>

<p>And lo! forthwith there rose up round about A lustre, over that already there; Of equal clearness, like the brightening up Of the horizon. As at evening hour Of twilight, new appearances through Heaven Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried; So, there, new substances, methought, began To rise in view beyond the other twain, 4 "The goodliest light."  Solomon.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xiv</p>

<p>And wheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.</p>

<p>O genuine glitter of eternal Beam! With what a sudden whiteness did it flow, O'erpowering vision in me.  But so fair, So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd, Mind cannot follow it, nor words express Her infinite sweetness. Thence mine eyes regain'd Power to look up; and I beheld myself, Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss5 Translated: for the star, with warmer smile Impurpled, well denoted our ascent.</p>

<p>With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks The same in all, an holocaust I made To God, befitting the new grace vouchsafed. And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd The fuming of that incense, when I knew The rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen And mantling crimson, in two listed rays The splendours shot before me, that I cried, "God of Sabaoth! that dost prank them thus!"</p>

<p>As leads the galaxy from pole to pole, Distinguish'd into greater lights and less, Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell; So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars, Those rays described the venerable sign, That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.</p>

<p>Here memory mocks the toil of genius. Christ Beam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now. But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ, Will pardon me for that I leave untold, When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy The glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn, And 'tween the summit and the base, did move Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd. Thus oft are seen with ever-changeful glance, Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow, The atomies of bodies, long or short, To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line Checkers the shadow interposed by art * "To more lofty bliss." To the planet Mars.</p>

<p>canto xv</p>

<p>PARADISE</p>

<p>347</p>

<p>Against the noontide heat. And as the chime Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and harp With many strings, a pleasant dinning makes To him, who heareth not distinct the note; So from the lights, which there appear'd to me, Gather'd along the cross a melody, That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment Possess'd me. Yet I mark'd it was a hymn Of lofty praises; for there came to me "Arise," and "Conquer," as to one who hears And comprehends not. Me such ecstasy O'ercame, that never, till that hour, was thing That held me in so sweet imprisonment.</p>

<p>Perhaps my saying overbold appears, Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes, Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire. But he, who is aware those living seals Of every beauty work with quicker force, The higher they are risen; and that there I had not turn'd me to them; he may well Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse I do accuse me, and may own my truth; That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd, Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.</p>

<p>CANTO XV</p>

<p>Argument.The spirit of Cacciaguida, our Poet's ancestor, glides rapidly to the foot of the cross; tells who he is; and speaks of the simplicity of the Florentines in his days, since then much corrupted.</p>

<p>TRUE love, that ever shows itself as clear In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong, Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd The sacred cords, that are by Heaven's right hand Unwound and tighten'd. How to righteous prayers Should they not hearken, who, to give me will For praying, in accordance thus were mute? He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief, Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not, Despoils himself forever of that love.</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xv</p>

<p>As oft along the still and pure serene, At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire, Attracting with involuntary heed The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest; And seems some star that shifted place in Heaven, Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost, And it is soon extinct: thus from the horn, That on the dexter of the cross extends, Down to its foot, one luminary ran From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem Dropp'd from its foil: and through the beamy list, Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.</p>

<p>So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost Of old Anchises, in the Elysian bower, When he perceived his son.  "O thou, my blood!</p>

<p>0 most exceeding grace divine! to whom, As now to thee, hath twice the heavenly gate Been e'er unclosed?" So spake the light: whence I Turn'd me toward him; then unto my dame</p>

<p>My sight directed: and on either side Amazement waited me; for in her eyes Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine Had dived unto the bottom of my grace And of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith, To hearing and to sight grateful alike, The spirit to his proem added things</p>

<p>1 understood not, so profound he spake: Yet not of choice, but through necessity, Mysterious; for his high conception soar'd Beyond the mark of mortals. When the flight Of holy transport had so spent it's rage, That nearer to the level of our thought</p>

<p>The speech descended; the first sounds I heard Were, "Blest be thou, Triunal Deity! That hast such favour in my seed vouchsafed." Then follow'd.  "No unpleasant thirst, though long, Which took me reading in the sacred book, Whose leaves or white or dusky never change, Thou hast allay'd, my son! within this light,</p>

<p>canto xv PARADISE 349</p>

<p>From whence my voice thou hear'st: more thanks to her,</p>

<p>Who, for such lofty mounting, has with plumes</p>

<p>Begirt thee. Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me</p>

<p>From Him transmitted, who is first of all,</p>

<p>E'en as all numbers ray from unity;</p>

<p>And therefore dost not ask me who I am,</p>

<p>Or why to thee more joyous I appear,</p>

<p>Than any other in this gladsome throng.</p>

<p>The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this life</p>

<p>Both less and greater in that Mirror look,</p>

<p>In which thy thoughts, or e'er thou think'st, are shown.</p>

<p>But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,</p>

<p>Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,</p>

<p>May be contented fully; let thy voice,</p>

<p>Fearless, and frank, and jocund, utter forth</p>

<p>Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,</p>

<p>Whereto my ready answer stands decreed."</p>

<p>I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard Ere I had spoken, smiling an assent, That to my will gave wings; and I began: "To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells, Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt; For that they are so equal in the Sun, From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat, As makes all likeness scant.  But will and means, In mortals, for the cause ye well discern, With unlike wings are fledged.  A mortal, I Experience inequality like this; And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart, For thy paternal greeting.  This howe'er I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st This precious jewel; let me hear thy name."</p>

<p>"I am thy root,1 O leaf! whom to expect Even, hath pleased me." Thus the prompt reply Prefacing, next it added:   "He, of whom2</p>

<p>"Florence, within her ancient limit-mark, Which calls her still3 to matin prayers and noon, Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace. She had no armlets and no head-tires then; No purfled dames; no zone, that caught the eye More than the person did.  Time was not yet, When4 at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale, For fear the age and dowry should exceed, On each side, just proportion.  House was none Void1 of its family: nor yet had come Sardanapalus,6 to exhibit feats Of chamber prowess. Montemalo7 yet O'er our suburban turret8 rose; as much To be surpast in fall, as in its rising. I saw Bellincion Berti9 walk abroad In leathern girdle, and a clasp of bone; And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,</p>

<p>him was born the father of our Poet, whom Benvenuto da Imola calls a lawyer by profession.</p>

D. 1259), and before and for a long time after, the citizens of Florence lived soberly, on coarse viands, and at little cost, and in many customs and courtesies of life were rude and unpolished; and dressed themselves and their women in coarse cloths: many wore plain leather, without cloth over it; bonnets on their heads; and all, boots on the feet; and the Florentine women were without ornament: the better sort content with a close gown of scarlet cloth of Yprcs or of camlet, bound with a girdle in the ancient mode, and a mantle lined with fur, and a hood to it, which was worn on the head; the common sort of women were clad in a coarse gown of Cambrai in like manner . . . and with their coarse way of living and poverty [the Florentines] did greater and more virtuous deeds than have been done in our times with greater refinement and wealth."G.

<p>1 "With greeting." The Poet, who had addressed the spirit, not knowing him to be his ancestor, with a plain "Thou," now uses more ceremony, and calls him "You," according to a custom of the Romans in the latter times of the empire.</p>

<p>* Beatrice's smile reminded him of the female servant who, by her coughing, emboldened Queen Guenevcr to encourage Lancelot.  Sec Hell, Canto v. 124.</p>

<p>Whose base affection many a spirit soils; And from the martyrdom came to this peace."</p>

<p>CANTO XVI</p>

<p>Argument.Cacciaguida relates the time of his birth; and, describing the extent of Florence when he lived there, recounts the names of the chief families who then inhabited it. Its degeneracy, and subsequent disgrace, he attributes lo the introduction of families from the neighboring country and villages, and to their mixture with the primitive citizens.</p>

<p>OSLIGHT respect of man's nobility! I never shall account it marvellous, That our infirm affection here below Thou movest to boasting; when I could not chuse, E'en in that region of unwarp'd desire, In Heaven itself, but make my vaunt in thee. Yet cloak thou art soon shorten'd; for that Time, Unless thou be eked out from day to day, Goes round thee with his shears. Resuming then, With greeting1 such as Rome was first to bear, But since hath disaccustom'd, I began: And Beatrice, that a little space Was sever'd, smiled; reminding me of her, Whose cough embolden'd (as the story holds) To first offence the doubting Guenever.3</p>

<p>"You are my sire," said I:  "you give me heart Freely to speak my thought: above myself You raise me. Through so many streams with joy My soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it; So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not. Say then, my honour'd stem! what ancestors Were those you sprang from, and what years were mark'd In your first childhood?

<p>All times are present; I, the whilst I scaled With Virgil the soul-purifying mount And visited the nether world of woe, Touching my future destiny have heard Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides Well squared to fortune's blows. Therefore my will Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me; The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks his flight."</p>

<p>So said I to the brightness, which erewhile To me had spoken; and my will declared, As Beatrice will'd, explicitly. Nor with oracular response obscure, Such as, or e'er the Lamb of God was slain, Beguiled the credulous nations: but, in terms Precise, and unambiguous lore, replied The spirit of paternal love, enshrined, Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake: "Contingency,1 whose verge extendeth not Beyond the tablet of your mortal mold, Is all depictured in the eternal sight; But hence deriveth not necessity,7 More than the tall ship, hurried down the flood, Is driven by the eye that looks on it. From thence,8 as to the ear sweet harmony From organ comes, so comes before mine eye The time prepared for thee.  Such as driven out From Athens, by his cruel stepdame's9 wiles, Hippolytus departed; such must thou Depart from Florence.

<p>Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes. And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul, Of him, but tell it not:" and things he told Incredible to those who witness them; Then added:   "So interpret thou, my son, What hath been told thee.Lo! the ambushment That a few circling seasons hide for thee. Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends Thy span beyond their treason's chastisement."</p>

<p>Soon as the saintly spirit, by silence, mark'd Completion of that web, which I had stretch'd Before it, warp'd for weaving; I began, As one, who in perplexity desires Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly: "My father! well I mark how time spurs on Toward me, ready to inflict the blow, Which falls most heavily on him who most Abandoneth himself.  Therefore 'tis good I should forecast, that, driven from the place17 Most dear to me, I may not lose myself " All other by my song. Down through the world Of infinite mourning; and along the mount, From whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me; And, after, through this Heaven, from light to light;</p>

<p>To whom these days shall be of ancient date."</p>

<p>The brightness, where enclosed the treasure1* smiled, Which I had found there, first shone glisteringly, Like to a golden mirror in the sun; Next answer'd:  "Conscience, dimm'd or by its own Or other's shame, will feel thy saying sharp. Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit removed,</p>

<p>CANTO XVIII</p>

<p>Argument.Dante sees the souls of many renowned warriors and crusaders in the planet Mars; and then ascends with Beatrice to Jupiter, the sixth heaven, in which he finds the souls of those who had administered justice rightly in the world, so disposed, as to form the figure of an eagle. The Canto concludes with an invective against the avarice of the clergy, and especially of the pope.</p>

<p>NOW in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'd That blessed spirit: and I fed on mine, Tempering the sweet with bitter. She meanwhile,</p>

<p>Who led me unto God, admonish'd:   "Muse On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong."</p>

<p>At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn'd; And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen, I leave in silence here, nor through distrust Of my words only, but that to such bliss The mind remounts not without aid. Thus much Yet may I speak; that, as I gazed on her, Affection found no room for other wish. While the everlasting pleasure, that did full On Beatrice shine, with second view From her fair countenance my gladden'd soul Contented; vanquishing me with a beam Of her soft smile, she spake:   "Turn thee, and list. These eyes are not thy only Paradise."</p>

<p>As here, we sometimes in the looks may see</p>

<p>See the whole vision be made manifest;</p>

<p>And let them wince, who have their withers wrung.</p>

<p>What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove</p>

<p>Unwelcome: on digestion, it will turn</p>

<p>To vital nourishment. The cry thou raisest,</p>

<p>Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;</p>

<p>Which is of honour no light argument.</p>

<p>For this, there only have been shown to thee,</p>

<p>Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,</p>

<p>Spirits, whom fame hath note of.  For the mind</p>

<p>Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce</p>

<p>And fix its faith, unless the instance brought</p>

<p>Be palpable, and proof apparent urge."</p>

<p>The affection mark'd, when that its sway hath ta'en</p>

<p>The spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,1</p>

<p>Might grace her triumph with them.  On the horns</p>

<p>Look, therefore, of the cross: he whom I name,</p>

<p>Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloud</p>

<p>Its nimble fire." Along the cross I saw,</p>

<p>At the repeated name of Joshua,</p>

<p>A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,</p>

<p>Ere it was done: then, at the naming, saw,</p>

<p>Of the great Maccabee,' another move</p>

<p>With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge</p>

<p>Unto that top.  The next for Charlemain</p>

<p>And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze</p>

<p>Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues</p>

<p>Who spake with me, among the other lights</p>

<p>Did move away, and mix; and with the quire</p>

<p>Of heavenly songsters proved his tuneful skill.</p>

<p>To Beatrice on my right I bent, Looking for intimation, or by word Or act, what next behoved; and did descry Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy, It pass'd all former wont. And, as by sense Of new delight, the man, who perseveres In good deeds, doth perceive, from day to day,</p>

<p>1 In which the spirit of Cacciaguida the age of Charlemain. The former, was enclosed. William I of Orange, supposed to have</p>

<p>His virtue growing; I e'en thus perceived, Of my ascent, together with the Heaven, The circuit widen'd; noting the increase Of beauty in that wonder.  Like the change In a brief moment on some maiden's cheek, Which, from its fairness, doth discharge the weight Of pudency, that stain'd it; such in her, And to mine eyes so sudden was the change, Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star, Whose sixth orb now enfolded us. I saw, Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks Of love, that reign'd there, fashion to my view Our language.  And as birds, from river banks Arisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop, Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems, Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights, The saindy creatures flying, sang; and made Now D, now I, now L, figured i' the air. First singing to their notes they moved; then, one Becoming of these signs, a little while Did rest them, and were mute. O nymph divine Of Pegasean race! who souls, which thou Inspirest, makcst glorious and long-lived, as they Cities and realms by thee; thou with thyself Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes, As fancy doth present them: be thy power Display'd in this brief song.

<p>And on the summit of the M, I saw</p>

<p>Descending other lights, that rested there,</p>

<p>Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good.</p>

<p>Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence Seem'd reascending; and a higher pitch Some mounting, and some less, e'en as the sun, Which kindleth them, decreed. And when each one Had setded in his place; the head and neck Then saw I of an eagle, livelily Graved in that streaky fire. Who painteth there,' Hath none to guide Him: of Himself He guides: And every line and texture of the nest Doth own from Him the virtue fashions it. The other bright beatitude," that seem'd Erewhile, with lilied crowning, well content To over-canopy the M, moved forth, Following gendy the impress of the bird.</p>

<p>Sweet star; what glorious and thick-studded gems Declared to me our justice on the earth To be the effluence of that Heaven, which thou, Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay. Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom Thy motion and thy virtue are begun, That He would look from whence the fog doth rise, To vitiate thy beam; so that once more' He may put forth his hand 'gainst such, as drive Their traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls With miracles and martyrdoms were built.</p>

<p>Ye host of Heaven, whose glory I survey! O beg ye grace for those, that are, on earth, All after ill example gone astray. War once had for his instrument the sword: But now 'tis made, taking the bread away,10 Which the good Father locks from none.And thou, That writest but to cancel,11 think, that they, Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died, Peter and Paul, live yet, and mark thy doings.</p>

<p>7 "Who painteth there." The Deity himself.</p>

<p>'That he may again drive out those who buy and sell in the temple.</p>

<p>10 "Taking the bread away." Excommunication, or interdiction of the Eucha-</p>

<p>Thou hast good cause to cry, "My heart so cleaves To him,12 that lived in solitude remote, And for a dance was dragg'd to martyrdom, I wist not of the Fisherman nor Paul."</p>

<p>CANTO XIX</p>

<p>Argument.The eagle speaks as with one voice proceeding from a multitude of spirits, that compose it; and declares the cause for which it is exalted to that state of glory. It then solves a doubt, which our Poet had entertained, respecting the possibility of salvation without belief in Christ; exposes the inefficacy of a mere profession of such belief; and prophesies the evil appearance that many Christian potentates will make at the day of judgment.</p>

<p>BEFORE my sight appear'd, with open wings, The beauteous image; in fruition sweet, Gladdening the thronged spirits. Each did seem A little ruby, whereon so intense The sun-beam glow'd, that to mine eyes it came In clear refraction. And that, which next Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd, Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy Was e'er conceived. For I beheld and heard The beak discourse; and, what intention form'd Of many, singly as of one express, Beginning:   "For that I was just and piteous, I am exalted to this height of glory, The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth Have I my memory left, e'en by the bad Commended, while they leave its course untrod."</p>

<p>Thus is one heat from many embers felt; As in that image many were the loves, And one the voice, that issued from them all: Whence I address'd them:  "O perennial flowers Of gladness everlasting! that exhale In single breath your odours manifold; Breathe now: and let the hunger be appeased, That with great craving long hath held my soul, Finding no food on earth.  This well I know;</p>

<p>11 "To him." The coin of Florence Pope is made to declare that he felt more was stamped with the impression of John devotion, than either for Peter or Paul, the Baptist; and, for this, the avaricious</p>

<p>To hearken; ye, the doubt, that urges me</p>

<p>With such inveterate craving."  Straight I saw,</p>

<p>Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,</p>

<p>That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,</p>

<p>His beauty and his eagerness bewraying;</p>

<p>So saw I move that stately sign, with praise</p>

<p>Of grace divine inwoven, and high song</p>

<p>Of inexpressive joy.   "He," it began,</p>

<p>"Who turn'd His compass on the world's extreme,</p>

<p>And in that space so variously hath wrought,</p>

<p>Both openly and in secret; in such wise</p>

<p>Could not, through all the universe, display</p>

<p>Impression of His glory, that the Word</p>

<p>Of His omniscience should not still remain</p>

<p>In infinite excess.   In proof whereof,</p>

<p>He first through pride supplanted, who was sum</p>

<p>No limit, measured by itself alone.</p>

<p>A single beam, its origin must own</p>

<p>Surpassing far its utmost potency.</p>

<p>The ken, your world is gifted with, descends</p>

<p>In the everlasting Justice as low down,</p>

<p>As eye doth in the sea; which, though it mark</p>

<p>The bottom from the shore, in the wide main</p>

<p>Discerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is;</p>

<p>But hidden through its deepness.  Light is none,</p>

<p>Save that which cometh from the pure serene</p>

<p>Of ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,</p>

<p>Tis darkness all; or shadow of the flesh,</p>

<p>Or else its poison.  Here confess reveal'd</p>

<p>Such frequent question; for thou said'st'A man</p>

<p>Is born on Indus' banks, and none is there</p>

<p>Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write;</p>

<p>And all his inclinations and his acts,</p>

<p>As far as human reason sees, are good;</p>

<p>And he offendeth not in word or deed:</p>

<p>But unbaptized he dies, and void of faith.</p>

<p>Where is the justice that condemns him? where</p>

<p>His blame, if he believeth not?'What then,</p>

<p>And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit</p>

<p>To judge at distance of a thousand miles</p>

<p>With the short-sighted vision of a span?</p>

<p>To him, who subtilizes thus with me,</p>

<p>There would assuredly be room for doubt</p>

<p>Even to wonder, did not the safe word</p>

<p>Of Scripture hold supreme authority.</p>

<p>"O animals of clay! O spirits gross! The Primal Will,' that in itself is good, Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been moved. Justice consists in consonance with it, Derivable by no created good, Whose very cause depends upon its beam."</p>

<p>As on her nest the stork, that turns about Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed, Whiles they with upward eyes do look on her; So lifted I my gaze; and, bending so, The ever-blessed image waved its wings, Labouring with such deep counsel. Wheeling round It warbled, and did say:  "As are my notes To thee, who understand'st them not; such is The eternal judgment unto mortal ken."</p>

<p>Then still abiding in that ensign ranged, Wherewith the Romans overawed the world, Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit Took up the strain; and thus it spake again: "None ever hath ascended to this realm, Who hath not a believer been in Christ, Either before or after the blest limbs Were nail'd upon the wood.

<p>* "Prague." The eagle predicts the devastation of Bohemia by Albert, which happened soon after this time, when that Emperor obtained the kingdom for his eldest son Rodolph.</p>

<p>7 "He." Philip IV of France, after the battle of Courtrai, 1302, in which the French were defeated by the Flemings,</p>

<p>raised the nominal value of the coin. This King died in consequence of his horse being thrown to the ground by a wild boar, in 1314.</p>

<p>8 "The English and Scot." He adverts to the disputes between John Baliol and Edward I, the latter of whom is commended in the Purgatory, Canto vii. 130.</p>

In the pupil is David; and, in the circle round it, Trajan, Hczekiah, Constantine, William II of Sicily, and Ripheus. It explains to our Poet how the souls of those whom he supposed to have had no means of believing in Christ, came to be in Heaven; and concludes with an admonition against presuming to fathom the counsels of God.</p>

<p>WHEN, disappearing from our hemisphere, The world's enlightener vanishes, and day On all sides wasteth; suddenly the sky, Erewhile irradiate only with his beam, Is yet again unfolded, putting forth Innumerable lights wherein one shines.

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xx</p>

<p>That Trojan Ripheus,10 in this round, was set, Fifth of the saintly splendours? now he knows Enough of that, which the world cannot see; The grace divine: albeit e'en his sight Reach not its utmost depth." Like to the lark, That warbling in the air expatiates long, Then, trilling out his last sweet melody, Drops, satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd That image, stampt by the everlasting pleasure, Which fashions, as they are, all things that be.</p>

<p>I, though my doubting were as manifest, As is through glass the hue that mantles it, In silence waited not; for to my lips "What things are these?" involuntary rush'd, And forced a passage out: whereat I mark'd A sudden lightening and new revelry. The eye was kindled; and the blessed sign, No more to keep me wondering and suspense, Replied:   "I see that thou believest these things, Because I tell them, but discern'st not how; So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith: As one, who knows the name of thing by rote, But is a stranger to its properties, Till other's tongue reveal them. Fervent love, And lively hope, with violence assail The Kingdom of the Heavens, and overcome The will of the Most High; not in such sort As man prevails o'er man; but conquers it, Because 'tis willing to be conquer'd; still, Though conquer'd, by its mercy, conquering.</p>

<p>"Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth, Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'st The region of the Angels deck'd with them. They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st, Gentiles, but Christians; in firm rooted faith, This,11 of the feet in future to be pierced, That,1* of feet nail'd already to the Cross.</p>

<p>CANTO XXI</p>

<p>Argument.Dante ascends with Beatrice to the seventh heaven, which is the planet Saturn; wherein is placed a ladder, so lofty, that the top of it is out of his sight. Here are the souls of those who had passed their life in holy retirement and contemplation. Piero Damiano comes near them, and answers questions put to him by Dante; then declares who he was on earth; and ends by declaiming against the luxury of pastors and prelates in those times.</p>

<p>AGAIN mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice;</p>

<p>/ \   And, with mine eyes, my soul that in her looks L    m Found all contentment.  Yet no smile she wore: And, "Did I smile," quoth she, "thou wouldst be straight Like Semele when into ashes turn'd; For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs, My beauty, which the loftier it climbs, As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more, So shines, that, were no tempering interposed, Thy mortal puissance would from its rays Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt. Into the seventh splendour1 are we wafted, That, underneath the burning lion's breast,2 Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might. Thy mind be with thine eyes; and, in them, mirror'd' The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown."</p>

"Mortal art thou in hearing, as in sight;" Was the reply: "and what forbade the smile7 Of Beatrice interrupts our song.

<p>"That in this court," said I, "O sacred lamp! Love no compulsion needs, but follows free The eternal Providence, I well discern: This harder find to deem: why, of thy peers, Thou only, to this office wert foredoom'd."</p>

<p>I had not ended, when, like rapid mill, Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and then The love that did inhabit there, replied: "Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds, Its virtue to my vision knits; and thus Supported, lifts me so above myself, That on the sovran Essence, which it wells from, I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy, Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze The keenness of my sight.   But not the soul,* That is in Heaven most lustrous, nor the Seraph, That hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall solve What thou hast ask'd: for in the abyss it lies Of th' everlasting statute sunk so low, That no created ken may fathom it.

By words like these Admonish'd, I the question urged no more; And of the spirit humbly sued alone To instruct me of its state.

Ravenna is supposed to have been the place of his birth, about 1007. He was employed in several important missions, ami rewarded by Stephen IX with the dignity of cardinal, and the bishopric of Ostia, to which, however, he preferred his former retreat in the monastery of Fonte Avellana, and prevailed on Alexander II to permit him to retire thither. Yet he did not long continue in this seclusion, before he was sent on other embassies. He died</p>

<p>at Faenza in 1072. His letters throw much light on the obscure history of these times. Besides them, he has left several treatises on sacred and ecclesiastical subjects. His eloquence is worthy of a better age." Tiraboschi, Storia della Lett. Ital.</p>

<p>14 Some editions and manuscripts have "fu," instead of "fui." According to the former of these readings, S. Pietro Damiano is made to distinguish himself from S. Pietro degli Oncsti, surnamed "II Peccator," founder of the monastery of S. Maria del Porto, on the Adriatic coast, near Ravenna, who died in n 19, at about eighty years of age.</p>

Next Dante mounts with his heavenly conductress to the eighth heaven, or that of the fixed stars, which he enters at the constellation of the Twins; and thence looking back, reviews all the space he has passed between his present station and the earth.</p>

<p>E'EN as the bird, who midst the leafy bower Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night, With her sweet brood; impatient to descry Their wished looks, and to bring home their food, In the fond quest unconscious of her toil: She, of the time prevenient, on the spray, That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn, Removeth from the east her eager ken: So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance Wistfully on that region,1 where the sun Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her Suspense and wondering, I became as one, In whom desire is waken'd, and the hope Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.</p>

<p>Short space ensued; I was not held, I say, Long in expectance, when I saw the Heaven Wax more and more resplendent; and, "Behold," Cried Beatrice, "the triumphal hosts Of Christ, and all the harvest gather'd in, Made ripe by these revolving spheres." Meseem'd, That, while she spake, her image all did burn; And in her eyes such fulness was of joy, As I am fain to pass unconstrued by.</p>

<p>As in the calm full moon, when Trivia2 smiles, In peerless beauty, 'mid the eternal nymphs,1 That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound; In bright pre-eminence so saw I there O'er million lamps a Sun, from whom all drew Their radiance, as from ours the starry train: And, through the living light, so lustrous glow'd The substance, that my ken endured it not.</p>

Here is the Might,4 And here the Wisdom, which did open lay The path, that had been yearned for so long, Betwixt the Heaven and earth." Like to the fire, That, in a cloud imprison'd, doth break out Expansive, so that from its womb enlarged,</p>

<p>It falleth against nature to the ground; Thus, in that heavenly banqueting, my soul Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost, Holds now remembrance none of what she was.</p>

<p>My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,</p>

<p>How merely, in her saindy looks, it wrought.</p>

<p>And, with such figuring of Paradise,</p>

<p>The sacred strain must leap, like one that meets</p>

And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms For very eagerness toward the breast, After the milk is taken; so outstretch'd Their wavy summits all the fervent band, Through zealous love to Mary: then, in view, There halted; and "Regina Cceli"15 sang So sweedy, the delight hath left me never.</p>

<p>Argument.St, Peter examines Dante touching Faith, and is contented with his answers.</p>

<p>" YE! in chosen fellowship advanced</p>

<p>I To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,</p>

<p>Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill'd; If to this man through God's grace be vouchsafed Foretaste of that, which from your table falls, Or ever death his fated term prescribe; Be ye not heedless of his urgent will: But may some influence of your sacred dews Sprinkle him. Of the fount ye alway drink, Whence flows what most he craves." Beatrice spake; And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres On firm-set poles revolving, trail'd a blaze Of comet splendour: and as wheels, that wind Their circles in the horologe, so work The stated rounds, that to the observant eye The first seems still, and as it flew, the last; E'en thus their carols weaving variously, They, by the measure paced, or swift, or slow, Made me to rate the riches of their joy.</p>

<p>From that, which I did note in beauty most Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame So bright, as none was left more goodly there. Round Beatrice thrice it wheel'd about, With so divine a song, that fancy's ear Records it not; and the pen passeth on, And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech, Nor e'en the inward shaping of the brain, Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.</p>

<p>"O saindy sister mine! thy prayer devout Is with so vehement affection urged, Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere."</p>

<p>Such were the accents towards my lady breathed From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay'd; To whom she thus: "O everlasting light Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss</p>

<p>Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou</p>

<p>In liveliest portraiture. But since true faith</p>

<p>Has peopled this fair realm with citizens;</p>

<p>Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,</p>

<p>Thou, in his audience, shouldst thereof discourse."</p>

<p>Like to the bachelor, who arms himself, And speaks not, till the master have proposed The question, to approve, and not to end it; So I, in silence, arm'd me, while she spake, Summoning up each argument to aid; As was behoveful for such questioner, And such profession: "As good Christian ought, Declare thee, what is faith?" Whereat I raised My forehead to the light, whence this had breathed; Then turn'd to Beatrice; and in her looks Approval met, that from their inmost fount I should unlock the waters. "May the grace, That giveth me the captain of the Church For confessor," said I, "vouchsafe to me Apt utterance for my thoughts;" then added: "Sire! E'en as set down by the unerring style Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspired To bring Rome in unto the way of life, Faith of things hoped is substance, and the proof Of things not seen; and herein doth consist Methinks its essence.""Rightly hast thou deem'd," Was answer'd; "if thou well discern, why first He hath defined it substance, and then proof."</p>

<p>"The deep things," I replied, "which here I scan Distinctly, are below from mortal eye So hidden, they have in belief alone Their being; on which credence, hope sublime Is built: and, therefore substance, it intends. And inasmuch as we must needs infer</p>

<p>canto xxiv PARADISE 389</p>

<p>From such belief our reasoning, all respect To other view excluded; hence of proof The intention is derived." Forthwith I heard: "If thus, whate'er by learning men attain, Were understood; the sophist would want room To exercise his wit." So breathed the flame Of love; then added: "Current is the coin Thou utter'st, both in weight and in alloy. But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse."</p>

<p>"Even so glittering and so round," said I, "I not a whit misdoubt of its assay." Next issued from the deep-imbosom'd splendour: "Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which Is founded every virtue, came to thee."</p>

<p>"The flood," I answer'd, "from the Spirit of God Rain'd down upon the ancient bond and new,1 Here is the reasoning that convinceth me So feelingly, each argument beside Seems blunt and forceless in comparison." Then heard I: "Wherefore holdest thou that each, The elder proposition and the new, Which so persuade thee, are the voice of Heaven?"</p>

<p>"The works, that follow'd, evidence their truth," I answer'd: "Nature did not make for these The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them."</p>

<p>"Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves," Was the reply, "that they in very deed Are that they purport? None hath sworn so to thee."</p>

<p>"That all the world," said I, "should have been turn'd</p>

<p>To Christian, and no miracle been wrought, Would in itself be such a miracle, The rest were not an hundredth part so great. E'en thou went'st forth in poverty and hunger To set the goodly plant, that, from the vine It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble."</p>

<p>That ended, through the high celestial court Resounded all the spheres, "Praise we one God!" 1 "The ancient bond and new." The Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>That, whatsoe'er has past them, I commend.</p>

<p>Behoves thee to express, what thou believest,</p>

<p>The next; and, whereon, thy belief hath grown."</p>

<p>"O saintly sire and spirit!" I began, "Who seest that, which thou didst so believe, As to outstrip feet younger than thine own, Toward the sepulchre; thy will is here, That I the tenour of my creed unfold; And thou, the cause of it, hast likewise ask'd. And I reply: I in one God believe; One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love All Heaven is moved, Himself unmoved the while. Nor demonstration physical alone, Or more intelligenual and abstruse, Persuades me to this faith: but from that truth It cometh to me rather, which is shed Through Moses; the rapt Prophets; and the Psalms; The Gospel; and what ye yourselves did write, When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost. In three eternal Persons I believe; Essence threefold and one; mysterious league Of union absolute, which, many a time, The word of gospel lore upon my mind Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark The lively flame dilates; and, like Heaven's star, Doth glitter in me." As the master hears, Well pleased, and then enfoldeth in his arms The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought, And having told the errand keeps his peace; Thus benediction uttering with song, Soon as my peace I held, compass'd me thrice</p>

Next St. John appears; and, on perceiving that Dante looks intently on him, informs him that he, St. John, had left his body resolved into earth, upon the earth, and that Christ and the Virgin alone had come with their bodies into Heaven.</p>

<p>IF e'er the sacred poem, that hath made Both Heaven and earth copartners in its toil, And with lean abstinence, through many a year, Faded my brow, be destined to prevail Over the cruelty, which bars me forth Of the fair sheep-fold,1 where, a sleeping lamb, The wolves set on and fain had worried me; With other voice, and fleece of other grain, I shall forthwith return; and, standing up At my baptismal font, shall claim the wreath Due to the poet's temples: for I there First enter'd on the faith, which maketh souls Acceptable to God: and, for its sake,2 Peter had then circled my forehead thus.</p>

<p>Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth The first fruit of Christ's vicars on the earth, Toward us moved a light, at view whereof My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me: "Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might, That makes Galicia throng'd with visitants."1 As when the ring-dove by his mate alights; In circles, each about the other wheels, And, murmuring, coos his fondness; thus saw I</p>

Multitudes from all parts of the world came to visit it. Many others were deterred by the difficulty of the journey, by the roughness</p>

<p>and barrenness of those parts, and by the incursions of the Moors, who made captives many of the pilgrims. The canons of St. Eloy, afterward (the precise time is not known), with a desire of remedying these evils, built, in many places along the whole road, which reached as far as to France, hospitals for the reception of the pilgrims."</p>

Smiling then, Beatrice spake: "O life in glory shrined! Who5 didst the largess of our kingly court Set down with faithful pen, let now thy voice, Of hope the praises, in this height resound. For well thou know'st, who figurest it as oft, As Jesus, to ye three, more brighdy shone."</p>

<p>"Lift up thy head; and be thou strong in trust: For that, which hither from the mortal world Arriveth, must be ripen'd in our beam."</p>

<p>Such cheering accents from the second flame* Assured me; and mine eyes I lifted up7 Unto the mountains, that had bow'd them late With over-heavy burden. "Sith our Liege Wills of His grace, that thou, or e'er thy death, In the most secret council with His lords Shouldst be confronted, so that having view'd The glories of our court, thou mayest therewith Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare, What is that hope? how it doth flourish in thee? And whence thou hadst it?"

<p>Like to the scholar, practised in his task, Who, willing to give proof of diligence, Seconds his teacher gladly; "Hope," said I, "Is of the joy to come a sure expectance, The effect of grace divine and merit preceding. This light from many a star, visits my heart; But flow'd to me, the first, from him who sang The songs of the Supreme; himself supreme Among his tuneful brethren. 'Let all hope In thee,' so spake his anthem, 'who have known Thy name;' and, with my faith, who knows not that? From thee, the next, distilling from his spring, In thine epistle, fell on me the drops So plenteously, that I on others shower The influence of their dew." Whileas I spake, A lamping, as of quick and volley'd lightning, Within the bosom of that mighty sheen10 Play'd tremulous; then forth these accents breathed: "Love for the virtue, which attended me E'en to the palm, and issuing from the field, Glows vigorous yet within me; and inspires To ask of thee, whom also it delights, What promise thou from hope, in chief, dost win."</p>

<p>"Both scriptures, new and ancient," I replied, "Propose the mark (which even now I view) For souls beloved of God. Isaias11 saith, 'That, in their own land, each one must be clad In two-fold vesture;' and their proper land Is this delicious life. In terms more full,</p>

In the dance, And in the song, it mingled. And the dame Held on them fix'd her looks; e'en as the spouse, Silent, and moveless. "This" is he, who lay Upon the bosom of our Pelican: This he, into whose keeping, from the Cross, The mighty charge was given." Thus she spake: Yet therefore naught the more removed her sight From marking them: or e'er her words began, Or when they closed.

<p>"Philosophy," said I, "hath arguments, And this place hath authority enough, To imprint in me such love: for, of constraint, Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good, Kindles our love; and in degree the more, As it comprises more of goodness in't. The essence then, where such advantage is, That each good, found without it, is naught else But of His light the beam, must needs attract The soul of each one, loving, who the truth Discerns, on which this proof is built. Such truth Learn I from Him, who shows me the first love Of all intelligential substances Eternal: from His voice I learn, whose word Is truth; that of Himself to Moses saith, 'I will make all My good before thee pass:' Lastly, from thee I learn, who chief proclaim'st, E'en at the outset3 of thy heralding, In mortal ears the mystery of Heaven."</p>

<p>"Through human wisdom, and the authority Therewith agreeing," heard I answer'd, "keep The choicest of thy love for God. But say, If thou yet other cords within thee feel'st, That draw thee towards Him; so that thou report How many are the fangs, with which this love Is grappled to thy soul." I did not miss, To what intent the eagle of our Lord* Had pointed his demand; yea, noted well The avowal which he led to; and resumed: "All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God, Confederate to make fast our charity. The being of the world; and mine own being; The death which He endured, that I should live; And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do; "At the outset."

<p>I ended: and therewith a song most sweet Rang through the spheres; and "Holy, holy, holy," Accordant with the rest, my lady sang. And as a sleep is broken and dispersed Through sharp encounter of the nimble light, With the eye's spirit running forth to meet The ray, from membrane on to membrane urged; And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees; So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems Of all around him, till assurance waits On better judgment: thus the saintly dame Drove from before mine eyes the motes away, With the resplendence of her own, that cast Their brightness downward, thousand miles below.

Like the leaf, That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown; By its own virtue rear'd, then stands aloof: So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow'd. Then eagerness to speak embolden'd me; And I began: "O fruit! that wast alone Mature, when first engender'd; ancient father! That doubly seest in every wedded bride Thy daughter, by affinity and blood; Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold Converse with me: my will thou seest: and I, More speedily to hear thee, tell it not."</p>

<p>Thou hold'st most certain: for that will I see</p>

<p>In his broad pathway, saw I him return,</p>

<p>Thousand save seventy times, the whilst I dwelt</p>

<p>Upon the earth. The language I did use</p>

<p>Was worn away, or ever Nimrod's race</p>

<p>Their unaccomplishable work began.</p>

<p>For naught, that man inclines to, e'er was lasting;</p>

<p>CANTO XXVII</p>

<p>Arcument.St. Peter bitterly rebukes the covetousness of his successors in the Apostolic See, while all the heavenly host sympathize in his indignation; they then vanish upward. Beatrice bids Dante again cast his view below. Afterward they are borne into the ninth heaven, of which she shows him the nature and properties; blaming the pcrverseness of man, who places his will on low and perishable things.</p>

<p>THEN "Glory to the Father, to the Son, And to the Holy Spirit," rang aloud Throughout all Paradise; that with the song My spirit reel'd, so passing sweet the strain. And what I saw was equal ecstasy: One universal smile it seem'd of all things; Joy past compare; gladness unutterable; Imperishable life of peace and love; Exhaustless riches, and unmeasured bliss.</p>

<p>Before mine eyes stood the four torches' lit: And that,2 which first had come, began to wax In brightness; and, in semblance, such became, As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds, And interchanged their plumes. Silence ensued, Through the blest quire; by Him, who here appoints Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin'd; When thus I heard: "Wonder not, if my hue Be changed; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see All in like manner change with me. My place He3 who usurps on earth, (my place, ay, mine, Which in the presence of the Son of God Is void,) the same hath made my cemetery A common sewer of puddle and of blood:</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xxvii</p>

<p>Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal, Were, to her beauty, nothing. Its boon influence From the fair nest of Leda14 rapt me forth, And wafted on into the swiftest Heaven.</p>

<p>What place for entrance Beatrice chose, I may not say; so uniform was all, Liveliest and loftiest. She my secret wish Divined; and, with such gladness, that God's love Seem'd from her visage shining, thus began: "Here is the goal, whence motion on his race Starts: motionless the centre, and the rest All moved around. Except the soul divine, Place in this Heaven is none; the soul divine, Wherein the love, which ruleth o'er its orb, Is kindled, and the virtue, that it sheds: One circle, light and love, enclasping it, As this doth clasp the others; and to Him, Who draws the bound, its limit only known. Measured itself by none, it doth divide Motion to all, counted unto them forth, As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten. The vase, wherein time's roots are plunged, thou seest: Look elsewhere for the leaves. O mortal lust! That canst not lift thy head above the waves Which whelm and sink thee down. The will in man Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain, Made mere abortion: faith and innocence Are met with but in babes; each taking leave, Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled: he, that fasts While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose Gluts every food alike in every moon: One, yet a babbler, loves and listens to His mother; but no sooner hath free use Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave. So suddenly doth the fair child of him, Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting, To negro blackness change her virgin white.</p>

<p>14 "The fair nest of Leda." From the Gemini; thus called, because Leda was the mother of the twins, Castor and Pollux.</p>

<p>"Thou, to abate thy wonder, note, that none Bears rule in earth; and its frail family Are therefore wanderers. Yet before the date, When through the hundredth in his reckoning dropt, Pale January must be shoved aside From winter's calendar, these heavenly spheres Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain" To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow; So that the fleet run onward: and true fruit, Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom."</p>

<p>CANTO XXVIII</p>

<p>Arcument.Still in the ninth heaven, our Poet is permitted to behold the divine essence; and then sees, in three hierarchies, the nine choirs of angels. Beatrice clears some difficulties which occur to him on this occasion.</p>

<p>SO she, who doth imparadise my soul, Had drawn the veil from off our present life, And bared the truth of poor mortality: When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies The shining of a flambeau at his back, Lit sudden ere he deem of its approach, And turneth to resolve him, if the glass Have told him true, and sees the record faithful As note is to its metre; even thus, I well remember, did befal to me, Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love Had made the leash to take me. As I turn'd: And that which none, who in that volume looks, Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck My view; a point I saw, that darted light So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up Against its keenness. The least star we ken From hence, had seem'd a moon; set by its side, As star by side of star. And so far off, Perchance, as is the halo from the light Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads;</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY canto</p>

<p>There wheel'd about the point a circle of fire,</p>

<p>More rapid than the motion which surrounds,</p>

<p>Speediest, the world. Another this enring'd;</p>

<p>And that a third; the third a fourth, and that</p>

<p>A fifth encompass'd; which a sixth next bound;</p>

<p>And over this, a seventh, following, reach'd</p>

<p>Circumference so ample, that its bow,</p>

<p>Within the span of Juno's messenger,</p>

<p>Had scarce been held entire. Beyond a seventh,</p>

<p>Ensued yet other two. And every one,</p>

<p>As more in number distant from the first,</p>

<p>Was tardier in motion: and that glow'd</p>

<p>With flame most pure, that to the sparkle of truth,</p>

<p>Was nearest; as partaking most, methinks,</p>

<p>Of its reality. The guide beloved</p>

<p>Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:</p>

<p>"Heaven, and all nature, hangs upon that point.</p>

<p>The circle thereto most conjoin'd observe;</p>

<p>And know, that by intenser love its course</p>

<p>Is, to this swiftness, wing'd." To whom I thus:</p>

<p>"It were enough; nor should I further seek,</p>

<p>Had I but witness'd order, in the world</p>

<p>Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen.</p>

<p>But in the sensible world such difference is,</p>

<p>That in each round shows more divinity,</p>

<p>As each is wider from the centre. Hence,</p>

<p>If in this wondrous and angelic temple,</p>

<p>That hath, for confine, only light and love,</p>

<p>My wish may have completion, I must know,</p>

<p>Wherefore such disagreement is between</p>

<p>The exemplar and its copy: for myself,</p>

<p>Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause."</p>

<p>"It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil'd Do leave the knot untied: so hard 'tis grown For want of tenting." Thus she said: "But take," She added, "if thou wish thy cure, my words, And entertain them subtly. Every orb, Corporeal, doth proportion its extent Unto the virtue through its parts diffused. The greater blessedness preserves the more,</p>

<p>CANTO XXVIII PARADISE 45</p>

<p>The greater is the body (if all parts</p>

<p>Share equally) the more is to preserve.</p>

<p>Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheels</p>

<p>The universal frame, answers to that</p>

<p>Which is supreme in knowledge and in love.</p>

<p>Thus by the virtue, not the seeming breadth</p>

<p>Of substance, measuring, thou shalt see the Heavens,</p>

<p>Each to the intelligence that ruleth it,</p>

<p>Greater to more, and smaller unto less,</p>

<p>Suited in strict and wondrous harmony."</p>

<p>As when the north blows from his milder cheek A blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air, Clear'd of the rack that hung on it before, Glitters; and, with his beauties all unveil'd, The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles: Such was my cheer, when Beatrice drove With clear reply the shadows back, and truth Was manifested, as a star in Heaven. And when the words were ended, not unlike To iron in the furnace, every cirque, Ebullient, shot forth scintillating fires: And every sparkle shivering to new blaze, In number1 did outmillion the account Reduplicate upon the chequer'd board. Then heard I echoing on, from choir to choir, "Hosanna," to the fixed point, that holds, And shall for ever hold them to their place, From everlasting, irremovable.</p>

<p>Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw</p>

<p>My inward meditations, thus began:</p>

<p>"In the first circles, they, whom thou beheld'st</p>

<p>Are Seraphim and Cherubim. Thus swift</p>

<p>Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,</p>

<p>Near as they can, approaching; and they can</p>

<p>The more, the loftier their vision. Those</p>

<p>That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,</p>

<p>Are Thrones; in whom the first trine ends. And all</p>

<p>1 "In number." The sparkles exceeded next, two; for the third, four; and so</p>

<p>the number which would be produced by went on doubling to the end of the ac-</p>

<p>the sixty-four squares of a chess-board, if count, for the first we reckoned one; for the</p>

<p>The meed, as unto each, in due degree,</p>

<p>Grace and good-will their measure have assign'd.</p>

<p>The other trine, that with still opening buds</p>

<p>In this eternal springtide blossom fair,</p>

<p>Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,2</p>

<p>Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold</p>

<p>Hosannas, blending ever; from the three,</p>

<p>Transmitted, hierarchy of gods, for aye</p>

<p>Rejoicing; dominations first; next them,</p>

<p>Virtues; and powers the third; the next to whom</p>

<p>Are princedoms and archangels, with glad round</p>

<p>To tread their festal ring; and last, the band</p>

<p>Angelical, disporting in their sphere.</p>

<p>All, as they circle in their orders, look</p>

<p>Aloft; and, downward, with such sway prevail,</p>

<p>That all with mutual impulse tend to God.</p>

<p>These once a mortal view beheld. Desire</p>

<p>In Dionysius,3 so intensely wrought,</p>

<p>That he, as 1 have done, ranged them; and named,</p>

<p>Their orders, marshal'd in his thought. From him,</p>

<p>Dissentient, one refused his sacred read.</p>

<p>But soon as in this Heaven his doubting eyes</p>

<p>Were opcn'd, Gregory4 at his error smiled.</p>

<p>Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth</p>

<p>Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt*</p>

<p>1 Not injured, like spring products, by the influence of autumn, when the constellation Aries rises at sunset.</p>

<p>3 The Areopagite, in his book "De Ccelcsti Hierarchia."</p>

<p>* "Gregory." Gregory the Great.</p>

<p>s "He had learnt." Dionysius, he says, had learnt from St. Paul. The book above referred to, which goes under his name, was the production of a later age. In Bishop Bull's seventh sermon, which treats of the different degrees of beatitude</p>

<p>in Heaven, there is much that resembles what is said on the same subject by our Poet. The learned prelate, however, appears a little inconsistent, when, after having blamed Dionysius the Arcopagite, "for reckoning up exactly the several orders of the angelical hierarchy, as if he had seen a muster of the heavenly host before his eyes" (v. i. p. 313), he himself speaks more particularly of the several orders in the celestial hierarchy than Holy Scripture warrants.</p>

<p>CANTO XXIX</p>

<p>Argument.Beatrice beholds, in the mirror of divine truth, some doubts which had entered the mind of Dante. These she resolves; and then digresses into a vehement reprehension of certain theologians and preachers in those days, whose ignorance or avarice induced them to substitute their own inventions for the pure word of the Gospel.</p>

<p>NO longer, than what time Latona's twins Cover'd of Libra and the fleecy star, Together both, girding the horizon hang; In even balance, from the zenith poised; Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere, Part the nice level; e'en so brief a space Did Beatrice's silence hold. A smile Sat painted on her cheek; and her fix'd gaze Bent on the point, at which my vision fail'd: When thus, her words resuming, she began: "I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand; For I have mark'd it, where all time and place Are present. Not for increase to Himself Of good, which may not be increased, but forth To manifest His glory by its beams; Inhabiting His own eternity, Beyond time's limit or what bound soe'er To circumscribe His being; as He will'd, Into new natures, like unto Himself, Eternal Love unfolded. Nor before, As if in dull inaction, torpid, lay. For, not in process of before or aft, Upon these waters moved the Spirit of God. Simple and mix'd, both form and substance, forth To perfect being started, like three darts Shot from a bow three-corded. And as ray In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire, E'en at the moment of its issuing; thus Did, from the eternal Sovran, beam entire His threefold operation, at one act</p>

<p>Long tract of ages by the Angels past,</p>

<p>Ere the creating of another world,</p>

<p>But that what I disclose to thee is true,</p>

<p>Those penmen,1 whom the Holy Spirit moved</p>

<p>In many a passage of their sacred book,</p>

<p>Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find:</p>

<p>And reason,3 in some sort, discerns the same,</p>

<p>Who scarce would grant the heavenly ministers,</p>

<p>Of their perfection void, so long a space.</p>

<p>Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,</p>

<p>Thou know'st, and how: and, knowing, hast allay'd</p>

<p>Thy thirst, which from the triple question4 rose.</p>

<p>Ere one had reckon'd twenty, e'en so soon,</p>

<p>Part of the Angels fell: and in their fall,</p>

<p>Confusion to your elements ensued.</p>

<p>The others kept their station: and this task,</p>

<p>Whereon thou look'st, began, with such delight,</p>

<p>That they surcease not ever, day nor night,</p>

<p>Their circling. Of that fatal lapse the cause</p>

<p>Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen</p>

<p>Pent with the world's incumbrance. Those, whom here</p>

<p>Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves</p>

<p>Of His free bounty, who had made them apt</p>

<p>For ministeries so high: therefore their views</p>

<p>Were, by enlightening grace and their own merit,</p>

<p>Exalted; so that in their will confirm'd</p>

<p>They stand, nor fear to fall. For do not doubt,</p>

<p>But to receive the grace, which Heaven vouchsafes,</p>

<p>1 St. Jerome had described the Angels as created long before the rest of the universe; an opinion which Thomas Aquinas controverted.</p>

<p>* As in Gen. i. i, and Eccles. xviii. i.</p>

<p>' "Reason." The heavenly ministers ("motori")  would have existed to no</p>

<p>purpose if they had been created before the corporeal world, which they were to govern.</p>

<p>* He had wished to know where, when, and how the Angels had been created, and these three questions had been resolved.</p>

<p>PARADISE</p>

<p>Is meritorious, even as the soul</p>

<p>With prompt affection welcometh the guest.</p>

<p>Now, without further help, if with good heed</p>

<p>My words thy mind have treasured, thou henceforth</p>

<p>This consistory round about mayst scan,</p>

<p>And gaze thy fill. But, since thou hast on earth</p>

<p>Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,</p>

<p>Canvass the angelic nature, and dispute</p>

<p>Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;</p>

<p>Therefore, 'tis well thou take from me the truth,</p>

<p>Pure and without disguise; which they below,</p>

<p>Equivocating, darken and perplex.</p>

<p>"Know thou, that, from the first, these substances, Rejoicing in the countenance of God, Have held unceasingly their view, intent Upon the glorious vision, from the which Nought absent is nor hid: where then no change Of newness, with succession, interrupts, Remembrance, there, needs none to gather up Divided thought and images remote.</p>

<p>"So that men, thus at variance with the truth, Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some Of error; others well aware they err, To whom more guilt and shame are justly due. Each the known track of sage philosophy Deserts, and has a bye-way of his own: So much the resdess eagerness to shine, And love of singularity prevail. Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes Heaven's anger less, than when the Book of God Is forced to yield to man's authority, Or from its straightness warp'd: no reckoning made What blood the sowing of it in the world Has cost; what favour for himself he wins, Who meekly clings to it. The aim of all Is how to shine: e'en they, whose office is To preach the Gospel, let the Gospel sleep, And pass their own inventions off instead. One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan moon Bent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sun</p>

Christ said not to His first conventicle, 'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,' But gave them truth to build on; and the sound Was mighty on their lips: nor needed they, Beside the Gospel, other spear or shield, To aid them in their warfare for the faith. The preacher now provides himself with store Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl Distends, and he has won the meed he sought: Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while Of that dark bird which nesdes in his hood, They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said, Which now the dotards hold in such esteem, That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad The hands of holy promise, finds a throng Of credulous fools beneath.

<p>Argument.Dante is taken up with Beatrice into the empyrean; and there having his sight strengthened by her aid, and by the virtue derived from looking on the river of light, he sees the triumph of the Angels and of the souls of the blessed.</p>

<p>NOON'S fervid hour perchance six thousand miles' From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone Almost to level on our earth declines; When, from the midmost of this blue abyss, By turns some star is to our vision lost. And straightway as the handmaid of the sun Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light, Fade; and the spangled firmament shuts in, E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng. Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight The triumph, which plays ever round the point, That overcame me, seeming (for it did) Engirt2 by that it girdeth. Wherefore love, With loss of other object, forced me bend Mine eyes on Beatrice once again.</p>

<p>If all, that hitherto is told of her, Were in one praise concluded, 'twere too weak To furnish out this turn. Mine eyes did look On beauty, such, as I believe in sooth,</p>

<p>Not merely to exceed our human; but, That save its Maker, none can to the full Enjoy it. At this point o'erpower'd I fail; Unequal to my theme; as never bard Of buskin or of sock hath fail'd before. For as the sun doth to the feeblest sight, E'en so remembrance of that witching smile Hath dispossest my spirit of itself. Not from that day, when on this earth I first Beheld her charms, up to that view of them, Have I with song applausive ever ceased To follow; but now follow them no more; My course here bounded, as each artist's is, When it doth touch the limit of his skill.</p>

<p>She (such as I bequeath her to the bruit Of louder trump than mine, which hastcneth on Urging its arduous matter to the close) Her words resumed, in gesture and in voice Resembling one accustom'd to command: "Forth3 from the last corporeal are we come Into the Heaven, that is unbodied light; Light intellectual, replete with love; Love of true happiness, replete with joy; Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight. Here shalt thou look on either mighty host* Of Paradise; and one in that array, Which in the final judgment thou shalt see."</p>

<p>As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes The visive spirits, dazzled and bedimm'd; So, round about me, fulminating streams Of living radiance play'd, and left me swathed And veiled in dense impenetrable blaze. Such weal is in the love, that stills this heaven; For its own flame5 the torch thus fitting ever.</p>

<p>The brief assurance, than I understood</p>

<p>New virtue into me infused, and sight</p>

<p>Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain</p>

<p>Excess of light however pure. I look'd;</p>

<p>And, in the likeness of a river, saw</p>

<p>Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves</p>

<p>Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on</p>

<p>Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,</p>

<p>Incredible how fair: and, from the tide,</p>

<p>There ever and anon, outstarting, flew</p>

<p>Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flowers</p>

<p>Did set them, like to rubies, chased in gold:</p>

<p>Then, as if drunk with odours, plunged again</p>

<p>Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one</p>

<p>Re-enter'd, still another rose. "The thirst</p>

<p>Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflamed,</p>

<p>To search the meaning of what here thou seest,</p>

<p>The more it warms thee, pleases me the more,</p>

<p>But first behoves thee of this water drink,</p>

<p>Or e'er that longing be allay'd." So spake</p>

<p>The day-star of mine eyes: then thus subjoin'd:</p>

<p>"This stream; and these, forth issuing from its gulf,</p>

<p>And diving back, a living topaz each;</p>

<p>With all this laughter on its bloomy shores;</p>

<p>Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth</p>

<p>They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things</p>

<p>Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,</p>

<p>For that thy views not yet aspire so high."</p>

<p>Never did babe, that had outslept his wont, Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk, As I toward the water; bending me, To make the better mirrors of mine eyes In the refining wave: and as the eaves Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith Seem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round. Then as a troop of maskers, when they put Their vizors off, look other than before; The counterfeited semblance thrown aside: So into greater jubilee were changed Those flowers and sparkles; and distinct I saw,</p>

<p>Before me, either court of Heaven display'd.</p>

<p>O prime enlightener! thou who gavest me strength On the high triumph of Thy realm to gaze; Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd.</p>

<p>There is in Heaven a light, whose goodly shine Makes the Creator visible to all Created, that in seeing Him alone Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far, That the circumference were too loose a zone To girdle in the sun. All is one beam, Reflected from the summit of the first, That moves, which being hence and vigour takes. And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes His image mirror'd in the crystal flood, As if to admire his brave apparelling Of verdure and of flowers; so, round about, Eying the light, on more than million thrones, Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth Has to the skies return'd. How wide the leaves, Extended to their utmost, of this rose, Whose lowest step embosoms such a space Of ample radiance! Yet, nor amplitude Nor height impeded, but my view with ease Took in the full dimensions of that joy. Near or remote, what there avails, where God Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends Her sway? Into the yellow of the rose Perennial, which, in bright expansivencss, Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent Of praises to the never-wintering sun, As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace, Beatrice led me; and, "Behold," she said, "This fair assemblage; stoles of snowy white, How numberless. The city, where we dwell, Behold how vast; and these our seats so throng'd, Few now are wanting here.

<p>CANTO XXXI</p>

<p>Argument.The Poet expatiates further on the glorious vision described in the last Canto. On looking round for Beatrice, he finds that she has left him, and that an old man is at his side. This proves to be St. Bernard, who shows him that Beatrice has returned to her throne, and then points out to him the blessedness of the Virgin Mother.</p>

<p>IN fashion, as a snow white rose, lay then Before my view the saintly multitude,' Which in His own blood Christ espoused. Meanwhile, That other host,2 that soar aloft to gaze And celebrate His glory, whom they love, Hover'd around; and, like a troop of bees, Amid the vernal sweets alighting now, Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows, Flew downward to the mighty flower, or rose From the redundant petals, streaming back Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy, Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold:</p>

<p>416 THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xxxi</p>

<p>The rest was whiter than the driven snow; And, as they flitted down into the flower, From range to range, fanning their plumy loins, Whisper'd the peace and ardour, which they won From that soft winnowing. Shadow none, the vast Interposition of such numerous flight Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view Obstructed aught. For, through the universe, Wherever merited, celestial light Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents.</p>

<p>All there, who reign in safety and in bliss, Ages long past or new, on one sole mark Their love and vision fix'd. O trinal beam Of individual star, that charm'st them thus! Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below.'</p>

<p>If the grim brood,4 from Arctic shores that roam'd, (Where Helice' for ever, as she wheels, Sparkles a mother's fondness on her son), Stood in mute wonder 'mid the works of Rome, When to their view the Lateran arose In greatness more than earthly; I, who then From human to divine had past, from time Unto eternity, and out of Florence To justice and to truth, how might I chuse But marvel too? 'Twixt gladness and amaze, In sooth no will had I to utter aught, Or hear. And, as a pilgrim, when he rests Within the temple of his vow, looks round In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell Of all its goodly state; e'en so mine eyes Coursed up and down along the living light, Now low, and now aloft, and now around, Visiting every step. Looks I beheld, Where charity in soft persuasion sat; Smiles from within, and radiance from above; And, in each gesture, grace and honour high.</p>

<p>All Paradise survey'd: when round I turn'd</p>

<p>With purpose of my lady to inquire</p>

<p>Once more of things, that held my thought suspense.</p>

<p>But answer found from other than I ween'd;</p>

<p>For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,</p>

<p>I saw instead a senior, at my side,</p>

<p>Robed, as the rest, in glory. Joy benign</p>

<p>Glow'd in his eye, and o'er his cheek diffused,</p>

<p>With gestures such as spake a father's love.</p>

<p>And, "Whither is she vanish'd?" straight I ask'd.</p>

<p>"By Beatrice summon'd," he replied, "I come to aid thy wish. Looking aloft To the third circle from the highest, there Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit Hath placed her." Answering not, mine eyes I raised, And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow A wreath reflecting of eternal beams. Not from the centre of the sea so far Unto the region of the highest thunder, As was my ken from hers; and yet the form Came through that medium down, unmix'd and pure.</p>

<p>"O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest; Who, for my safety, hast not scorn'd, in Hell To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark'd; For all mine eyes have seen, I to thy power And goodness, virtue owe and grace. Of slave Thou hast to freedom brought me: and no means, For my deliverance apt, hast left untried. Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep: That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole, Is loosen'd from this body, it may find Favour with thee." So I my suit preferr'd: And she, so distant, as appear'd, look'd down, And smiled; then toward the eternal fountain turn'd.</p>

<p>And thus the senior, holy and revered: "That thou at length mayst happily conclude Thy voyage, (to which end I was despatch'd, By supplication moved and holy love), Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large, This garden through: for so, by ray divine</p>

<p>Who haply from Croatia wends to see</p>

<p>Our Veronica,' and, the while 'tis shown,</p>

<p>Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,</p>

<p>And, all that he hath heard revolving, saith</p>

<p>Unto himself in thought: "And didst Thou look</p>

<p>E'en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?</p>

<p>And was this semblance Thine?" So gazed I then</p>

<p>Adoring; for the charity of him,8</p>

<p>Who musing, in this world that peace enjoy'd,</p>

<p>Stood livelily before me. "Child of grace!"</p>

<p>Thus he began: "Thou shalt not knowledge gain</p>

<p>Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held</p>

<p>Still in this depth below. But search around</p>

<p>The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy</p>

<p>Seated in state, the Queen9 that of this realm</p>

<p>Is sovran." Straight mine eyes I raised; and bright,</p>

<p>As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime</p>

<p>Above the horizon, where the sun declines;</p>

<p>So to mine eyes, that upward, as from vale</p>

<p>Excell'd in lustre all the front opposed.</p>

<p>And as the glow burns ruddiest o'er the wave,</p>

<p>That waits the ascending team, which Phaeton</p>

<p>6 "Bernard." St. Bernard, the venerable Abbot of Clairvaux, and the great promoter of the Second Crusade, who died A. D. 1153, in his sixty-third year. He has been termed the last of the fathers of the Church. That the part he acts in the present poem should be assigned to him, appears somewhat remarkable, when we consider that he severely censured the new festival established in honor of the Immaculate Conception of</p>

<p>the Virgin, and "opposed the doctrine itself with the greatest vigor, as it supposed her being honored with a privilege which belonged to Christ alone."</p>

<p>' A copy in miniature of the picture of Christ, which is supposed to have been miraculously imprinted upon a handkerchief preserved in the church of St. Peter at Rome.</p>

<p>Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich, As is the colouring in fancy's loom, 'Twere all too poor to utter the least part Of that enchantment. When he saw mine eyes Intent on her, that charm'd him; Bernard gazed With so exceeding fondness, as infused Ardour into my breast, unfelt before.</p>

<p>CANTO XXXII</p>

<p>Argument.St Bernard shows him, on their several thrones, the other blessed souls, of both the Old and New Testament; explains to him that their places are assigned them by grace, and not according to merit; and, lastly, tells him that if he would obtain power to descry what remained of the heavenly vision, he must unite with him in supplication to Mary.</p>

<p>FREELY the sage, though wrapt in musings high, Assumed the teacher's part, and mild began: "The wound, that Mary closed, she1 open'd first, Who sits so beautiful at Mary's feet.

<p>And for a proof the effect may well suffice.</p>

<p>And 'tis moreover most expressly mark'd</p>

<p>To have struggled in the womb. Therefore, as grace</p>

<p>Inweaves the coronet, so every brow</p>

<p>Weareth its proper hue of orient light.</p>

<p>And merely in respect to his prime gift,</p>

<p>Not in reward of meritorious deed,</p>

<p>In early times with their own innocence</p>

<p>More was not wanting than the parents' faith,</p>

<p>In Christ accomplish'd, innocence herself</p>

<p>Must linger yet below. Now raise thy view</p>

<p>Unto the visage most resembling Christ:</p>

<p>For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win</p>

<p>The power to look on Him." Forthwith I saw</p>

<p>Such floods of gladness on her visage shower'd,</p>

<p>From holy spirits, winging that profound;</p>

<p>That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,</p>

<p>Had not so much suspended me with wonder,</p>

<p>Or shown me such similitude of God.</p>

<p>And he, who had to her descended, once,</p>

<p>On earth, now hail'd in Heaven; and on poised wing,</p>

<p>"Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena," sang:</p>

<p>To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,</p>

<p>From all parts answering, rang: that holier joy</p>

<p>Brooded the deep serene. "Father revered!</p>

<p>Say, who that Angel is, that with such glee</p>

<p>Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys</p>

<p>Of this sweet flower; near whom behold the seer,7</p>

<p>That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times</p>

<p>Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails</p>

<p>Was won. And, near unto the other, rests</p>

<p>The leader, under whom, on manna, fed</p>

<p>The ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.</p>

Here kneeleth one, Who of all spirits hath review'd the state, From the world's lowest gap unto this height. Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace For virtue yet more high, to lift his ken Toward the bliss supreme. And I, who ne'er Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself, Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer, (And pray they be not scant), that thou wouldst Each cloud of his mortality away, [drive</p>

<p>Through thine own prayers, that on the sovran joy Unveil'd he gaze. This yet, I pray thee, Queen,</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY</p>

<p>canto xxxin</p>

<p>Who canst do what thou wilt; that in him thou</p>

<p>Wouldst, after all he hath beheld, preserve</p>

<p>Affection sound, and human passions quell.</p>

<p>Lo! where, with Beatrice, many a saint</p>

<p>Stretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit."</p>

<p>The eyes, that Heaven with love and awe regards, Fix'd on the suitor, witness'd, how benign She looks on pious prayers: then fasten'd they On the everlasting light, wherein no eye Of creature, as may well be thought, so far Can travel inward. I, meanwhile, who drew Near to the limit, where all wishes end, The ardour of my wish (for so behoved) Ended within me. Beckoning smiled the sage, That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade, Already of myself aloft I look'd; For visual strength, refining more and more, Bare me into the ray authentical Of sovran light. Thenceforward, what I saw, Was not for words to speak, nor memory's self To stand against such outrage on her skill.</p>

<p>As one, who from a dream awaken'd, straight, All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains Impression of the feeling in his dream; E'en such am I: for all the vision dies, As 'twere, away; and yet the sense of sweet, That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart. Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal'd; Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost The Sibyl's sentence. O eternal beam! [soar?)</p>

<p>(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may Yield me again some little particle Of what Thou then appearedst; give my tongue Power, but to leave one sparkle of Thy glory, Unto the race to come, that shall not lose Thy triumph wholly, if Thou waken aught Of memory in me, and endure to hear The record sound in this unequal strain.</p>

<p>Such keenness from the living ray I met, That, if mine eyes had turn'd away, methinks,</p>

<p>canto xxxiii PARADISE 425</p>

<p>I had been lost; but, so embolden'd, on I pass'd, as I remember, till my view Hover'd the brink of dread infinitude.</p>

<p>O grace, unenvying of Thy boon! that gavest Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken On the everlasting splendour, that I look'd, While sight was unconsumed, and, in that depth, Saw in one volume clasp'd of love, whate'er The universe unfolds; all properties Of substance and of accident, beheld, Compounded, yet one individual light The whole. And of such bond methinks I saw The universal form; for that whene'er I do but speak of it, my soul dilates Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak, One moment seems a longer lethargy, Than five-and-twenty ages had appear'd To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder At Argo's shadow darkening on his flood.</p>

<p>With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,</p>

<p>Wondering I gazed; and admiration still</p>

<p>Was kindled as I gazed. It may not be,</p>

<p>That one, who looks upon that light, can turn</p>

<p>To other object, willingly, his view.</p>

<p>For all the good, that will may covet, there</p>

<p>Is summ'd; and all, elsewhere defective found,</p>

<p>Complete. My tongue shall utter now, no more</p>

<p>E'en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe's</p>

<p>That yet is moisten'd at his mother's breast.</p>

<p>Not that the semblance of the living light</p>

<p>Was changed, (that ever as at first remain'd),</p>

<p>But that my vision quickening, in that sole</p>

<p>Appearance, still new miracles descried,</p>

<p>And toil'd me with the change. In that abyss</p>

<p>Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem'd, methought,</p>

<p>Three orbs of triple hue, dipt in one bound:1</p>

<p>And, from another, one reflected seem'd,</p>

<p>1 "Three orbs of triple hue, dipt in one second, and third, and of the impocsi-</p>

<p>bound." The Trinity. This passage may bility that the human soul should attain</p>

<p>be compared to what Plato, in his second to what it desires to know of them, by</p>

<p>Epistle, enigmatically says of a first, means of anything akin to itself.</p>

<p>426</p>

<p>THE DIVINE COMEDY canto xxxia</p>

<p>As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third Seem'd fire, breathed equally from both. O speech! How feeble and how faint art thou, to give Conception birth. Yet this to what I saw Is less than little. O eternal Light! Sole in Thyself that dwell'st; and of Thyself Sole understood, past, present, or to come; Thou smiledst, on that circling,2 which in Thee Seem'd as reflected splendour, while I mused; For I therein, methought, in its own hue Beheld our image painted: steadfasdy I therefore pored upon the view. As one, Who versed in geometric lore, would fain Measure the circle; and, though pondering long And deeply, that beginning, which he needs, Finds not: e'en such was I, intent to scan The novel wonder, and trace out the form, How to the circle fitted, and therein How placed: but the flight was not for my wing; Had not a flash darted athwart my mind, And, in the spleen, unfolded what it sought.</p>

<p>Here vigour fail'd the towering fantasy: But yet the will roll'd onward, like a wheel In even motion, by the Love impell'd, That moves the sun in Heaven and all the stars.</p>

<p>1 "That circling." The second of the dimly beheld the mystery of the Incar-cirdes, "Light of Light," in which he    nation.</p>
