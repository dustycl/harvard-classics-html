<p>THE LADY OF SHALOTT</p>

<p>Part I</p>

<p>ON either side the river lie Long fields of barley and of rye, That clothe the wold and meet the sky; And thro' the field the road runs by</p>

<p>To many-tower'd Camelot; And up and down the people go, Gazing where the lilies blow Round an island there below,</p>

<p>The island of Shalott.</p>

<p>Willows whiten, aspens quiver, Little breezes dusk and shiver Thro' the wave that runs for ever By the island in the river</p>

<p>Flowing down to Camelot. Four gray walls, and four gray towers, Overlook a space of flowers, And the silent isle imbowers</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>By the margin, willow-veil'd, Slide the heavy barges trail'd By slow horses; and unhail'd The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd</p>

<p>Skimming down to Camelot: But who hath seen her wave her hand? Or at the casement seen her stand ? Or is she known in all the land,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott? 967</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Only reapers, reaping early In among the bearded barley, Hear a song that echoes cheerly From the river winding clearly,</p>

<p>Down to tower'd Camelot: And by the moon the reaper weary, Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers ' "Tis the fairy</p>

<p>Lady of Shalott.'</p>

<p>Part II</p>

<p>There she weaves by night and day A magic web with colours gay. She has heard a whisper say, A curse is on her if she stay</p>

<p>To look down to Camelot. She knows not what the curse may be, And so she weaveth steadily, And little other care hath she,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>And moving thro' a mirror clear That hangs before her all the year, Shadows of the world appear. There she sees the highway near</p>

<p>Winding down to Camelot: There the river eddy whirls, And there the surly village-churls, And the red cloaks of market girls,</p>

<p>Pass onward from Shalott.</p>

<p>Sometimes a troop of damsels glad, An abbot on an ambling pad, Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad, Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,</p>

<p>Goes by to tower'd Camelot: And sometimes thro' the mirror blue The knights come riding two and two: She hath no loyal knight and true,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>But in her web she still delights To weave the mirror's magic sights, For often thro' the silent nights A funeral, with plumes and lights,</p>

<p>And music, went to Camelot: Or when the moon was overhead, Came two young lovers lately wed; 'I am half sick of shadows,' said</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Part III</p>

<p>A bow-shot from her bower-eaves, He rode between the barley-sheaves, The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, And flamed upon the brazen greaves</p>

<p>Of bold Sir Lancelot. A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd To a lady in his shield, That sparkled on the yellow field,</p>

<p>Beside remote Shalott.</p>

<p>The gemmy bridle glitter'd free, Like to some branch of stars we see Hung in the golden Galaxy. The bridle bells rang merrily</p>

<p>As he rode down to Camelot: And from his blazon'd baldric slung A mighty silver bugle hung, And as he rode his armour rung,</p>

<p>Beside remote Shalott.</p>

<p>All in the blue unclouded weather Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather, The helmet and the helmet-feather Burn'd like one burning flame together,</p>

<p>As he rode down to Camelot. As often thro' the purple night, Below the starry clusters bright, Some bearded meteor, trailing light,</p>

<p>Moves over still Shalott.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; From underneath his helmet flow'd His coal-black curls as on he rode,</p>

<p>As he rode down to Camelot. From the bank and from the river He flash'd into the crystal mirror, 'Tirra Iirra,' by the river</p>

<p>Sang Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>She left the web, she left the loom, She made three paces thro' the room, She saw the water-lily bloom, She saw the helmet and the plume,</p>

<p>She look'd down to Camelot. Out flew the web and floated wide; The mirror crack'd from side to side; 'The curse is come upon me!' cried</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Part IV In the stormy east-wind straining, The pale yellow woods were waning, The broad stream in his banks complaining, Heavily the low sky raining</p>

<p>Over tower'd Camelot; Down she came and found a boat Beneath a willow left afloat, And round about the prow she wrote</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>And down the river's dim expanse Like some bold seer in a trance, Seeing all his own mischance With a glassy countenance</p>

<p>Did she look to Camelot. And at the closing of the day She loosed the chain, and down she lay; The broad stream bore her far away,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Lying, robed in snowy white That loosely flew to left and right The leaves upon her falling light Thro' the noises of the night</p>

<p>She floated down to Camelot: And as the boat-head wound along The willowy hills and fields among, They heard her singing her last song,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Heard a carol, mournful, holy, Chanted loudly, chanted lowly, Till her blood was frozen slowly, And her eyes were darken'd wholly,</p>

<p>Turn'd to tower'd Camelot; For ere she reach'd upon the tide The first house by the water-side, Singing in her song she died,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Under tower and balcony,</p>

<p>By garden-wall and gallery,</p>

<p>A gleaming shape she floated by,</p>

<p>Dead-pale between the houses high,</p>

<p>Silent into Camelot. Out upon the wharfs they came, Knight and burgher, lord and dame, And round the prow they read her name,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Who is this? and what is here? And in the lighted palace near Died the sound of royal cheer; And they cross'd themselves for fear,</p>

<p>All the knights at Camelot: But Lancelot mused a little space; He said, 'She has a lovely face; God in His mercy lend her grace,</p>

<p>The Lady of Shalott.'</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Sweet and Low</p>

<p>Sweet and low, sweet and low,</p>

<p>Wind of the western sea, Low, low, breathe and blow,</p>

<p>Wind of the western sea! Over the rolling waters go, Come from the dying moon, and blow,</p>

<p>Blow him again to me; While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.</p>

<p>Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,</p>

<p>Father will come to thee soon; Rest, rest, on mother's breast,</p>

<p>Father will come to thee soon; Father will come to his babe in the nest, Silver sails all out of the west</p>

<p>Under the silver moon: Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.</p>

<p>Tears, Idle Tears</p>

<p>Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean, Tears from the depth of some divine despair Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, In looking on the happy Autumn-fields, And thinking of the days that are no more.</p>

<p>Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail, That brings our friends up from the underworld, Sad as the last which reddens over one That sinks with all we love below the verge; So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.</p>

<p>Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns</p>

<p>The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds</p>

<p>To dying ears, when unto dying eyes</p>

<p>The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;</p>

<p>So sad, so strange, the days that are no more..</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Dear as remembered kisses after death, And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned On lips that are for others; deep as love, Deep as first love, and wild with all regret; O Death in Life, the days that are no more.</p>

<p>Blow, Bugle, Blow</p>

<p>The splendour falls on castle walls</p>

<p>And snowy summits old in story: The long light shakes across the lakes, And the wild cataract leaps in glory. Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.</p>

<p>O hark, O hear! how thin and clear, And thinner, clearer, farther going! O sweet and far from cliff and scar The horns of Elfland faintly blowing! Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying: Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.</p>

<p>O love, they die in yon rich sky,</p>

<p>They faint on hill or field or river: Our echoes roll from soul to soul, And grow for ever and for ever. Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.</p>

<p>Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead</p>

<p>Home they brought her warrior dead: She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:</p>

<p>All her maidens, watching, said, 'She must weep or she will die.'</p>

<p>Then they praised him, soft and low, Called him worthy to be loved,</p>

<p>Truest friend and noblest foe; Yet she neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Stole a maiden from her place, Lighdy to the warrior stepped,</p>

<p>Took the face-cloth from the face; Yet she neither moved nor wept.</p>

<p>Rose a nurse of ninety years, Set his child upon her knee</p>

<p>Like summer tempest came her tears 'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'</p>

<p>Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal</p>

<p>Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk; Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font: The fire-fly wakens: waken thou with me.</p>

<p>Now droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghos And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.</p>

<p>Now lies the Earth all Danae to the stars, And all thy heart lies open unto me.</p>

<p>Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.</p>

<p>Now folds the lily all her sweetness up, And slips into the bosom of the lake: So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip Into my bosom and be lost in me.</p>

<p>O Swallow, Swallow</p>

<p>O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South, Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves, And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.</p>

<p>O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each, That bright and fierce and fickle is the South, And dark and true and tender is the North.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill, And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.</p>

<p>O were I thou that she might take me in, And lay me on her bosom, and her heart Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.</p>

<p>Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,</p>

<p>Delaying as the tender ash delays</p>

<p>To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?</p>

<p>O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown: Say to her, I do but wanton in the South, But in the North long since my nest is made.</p>

<p>O tell her, brief is life but love is long, And brief the sun of summer in the North, And brief the moon of beauty in the South.</p>

<p>O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,</p>

<p>Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her m</p>

<p>And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.</p>

<p>Break, Break, Break</p>

<p>Break, break, break,</p>

<p>On thy cold grey stones, O Sea! And I would that my tongue could utter</p>

<p>The thoughts that arise in me.</p>

<p>O well for the fisherman's boy,</p>

<p>That he shouts with his sister at play!</p>

<p>O well for the sailor lad, That he sings in his boat on the bay!</p>

<p>And the stately ships go on To their haven under the hill;</p>

<p>But O for the touch of a vanished hand, And the sound of a voice that is still!</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Break, break, break,</p>

<p>At the foot of thy crags, O Sea! But the tender grace of a day that is dead</p>

<p>Will never come back to me.</p>

<p>In the Valley of Cauteretz</p>

<p>All along the valley, stream that nastiest white,</p>

<p>Deepening thy voice with the deepening of the night,</p>

<p>All along the valley, where thy waters flow,</p>

<p>I walked with one I loved two and thirty years ago.</p>

<p>All along the valley while I walked to-day,</p>

<p>The two and thirty years were a mist that rolls away;</p>

<p>For all along the valley, down thy rocky bed,</p>

<p>Thy living voice to me was as the voice of the dead,</p>

<p>And all along the valley, by rock and cave and tree,</p>

<p>The voice of the dead was a living voice to me.</p>

<p>Vivien's Song</p>

<p>'In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours, Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers: Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.</p>

<p>'It is the little rift within the lute, That by and by will make the music mute, And ever widening slowly silence all.</p>

<p>'The little rift within the lover's lute Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit, That rotting inward slowly moulders all.</p>

<p>'It is not worth the keeping: let it go: But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no. And trust me not at all or all in all.'</p>

<p>Enid's Song</p>

<p>Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud; Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud; Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown; With that wild wheel we go not up or down; Our hoard is litde, but our hearts are great.</p>

<p>Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands; Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands; For man is man and master of his fate.</p>

<p>Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd; Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud; Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</p>

<p>Ulysses It litde profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard and sleep, and feed, and know not me.</p>

<p>I cannot rest from travel: I will drink Life to the lees: all times I have enjoy'd Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known; cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honour'd of them all; And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains: but every hour is saved From that eternal silence, something more,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge, like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.</p>

<p>This is my son, mine own Telemachus, To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil This labour, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.</p>

<p>There lies the port: the vessel puffs her sail: There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners, Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheadsyou and I are old; Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Locksley Hall</p>

<p>Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn:</p>

<p>Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn.</p>

<p>'Tis the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call, Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;</p>

<p>Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts, And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.</p>

<p>Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest, Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.</p>

<p>Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade, Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.</p>

<p>Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;</p>

<p>When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed; When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:</p>

<p>When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;</p>

<p>Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.</p>

<p>In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast; In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;</p>

<p>In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;</p>

<p>In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.</p>

<p>Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young, And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.</p>

<p>And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me, Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee."</p>

<p>One equal temper of heroic hearts,</p>

<p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>

<p>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>

<p>980 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light, As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.</p>

<p>And she turn'dher bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes</p>

<p>Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong;" Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee long."</p>

<p>Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands; Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.</p>

<p>Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might; Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.</p>

<p>Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,</p>

<p>And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fullness of the Spring.</p>

<p>Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships, And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.</p>

<p>O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more! O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!</p>

<p>Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung, Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!</p>

<p>Is it well to wish thee happy? having known meto decline On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!</p>

<p>Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level day by day,</p>

<p>What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay.</p>

<p>As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,</p>

<p>And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.</p>

<p>He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force, Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.</p>

<p>What is this? his eyes are heavy: think not they are glazed with wine. Go to him: it is thy duty: kiss him: take his hand in thine.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 981</p>

<p>It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is over-wrought:</p>

<p>Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.</p>

<p>He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!</p>

<p>Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace, Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.</p>

<p>Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth! Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!</p>

<p>Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule! Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!</p>

<p>Well'tis well that I should bluster!Hadst thou less unworthy proved</p>

<p>Would to Godfor I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.</p>

<p>Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit? I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.</p>

<p>Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.</p>

<p>Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind? Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind ?</p>

<p>I remember one that perish'd: sweetly did she speak and move: Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.</p>

<p>Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore? Noshe never loved me truly: love is love for evermore.</p>

<p>Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings, That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.</p>

<p>Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof. In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.</p>

<p>982 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall, Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.</p>

<p>Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep, To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.</p>

<p>Thou shalt hear the "Never, never," whisper'd by the phantom years, And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;</p>

<p>And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain. Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow: get thee to thy rest again.</p>

<p>Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry. 'Tis a purer life than thine; a lip to drain thy trouble dry.</p>

<p>Baby lips will laugh me down: my latest rival brings thee rest. Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.</p>

<p>O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due. Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.</p>

<p>O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,</p>

<p>With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.</p>

<p>"They were dangerous guides the feelingsshe herself was not exempt Truly, she herself had suffer'd"Perish in thy self-contempt!</p>

<p>Overlive itlower yetbe happy! wherefore should I care? I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.</p>

<p>What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these? Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.</p>

<p>Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow. I have but an angry fancy: what is that which I should do?</p>

<p>I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,</p>

<p>When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound.</p>

<p>But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels, And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 983</p>

<p>Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.</p>

<p>Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!</p>

<p>Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife, When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;</p>

<p>Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield, Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,</p>

<p>And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn, Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;</p>

<p>And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then, Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men:</p>

<p>Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new: That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:</p>

<p>For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,</p>

<p>Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;</p>

<p>Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails, Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;</p>

<p>Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;</p>

<p>Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm, With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;</p>

<p>Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.</p>

<p>There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe, And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.</p>

<p>So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,</p>

<p>Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;</p>

<p>Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint, Science moves, but slowly slowly, creeping on from point to point:</p>

<p>984 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion creeping nigher, Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.</p>

<p>Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,</p>

<p>And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.</p>

<p>What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys, Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?</p>

<p>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore, And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.</p>

<p>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast, Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.</p>

<p>Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn, They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:</p>

<p>Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string? I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.</p>

<p>Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:</p>

<p>Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine, Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine</p>

<p>Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;</p>

<p>Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd; I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.</p>

<p>Or to burst all links of habitthere to wander far away, On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.</p>

<p>Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies, Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.</p>

<p>Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag;</p>

<p>Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 985</p>

<p>Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.</p>

<p>There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind, In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.</p>

<p>There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing-space;</p>

<p>I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.</p>

<p>Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run, Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;</p>

<p>Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks, Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books</p>

<p>Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I /{now my words are wild, But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.</p>

<p>I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains, Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!</p>

<p>Mated with a squalid savagewhat to me were sun or clime? I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time</p>

<p>I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,</p>

<p>Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!</p>

<p>Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range.</p>

<p>Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.</p>

<p>Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day: Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.</p>

<p>Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:</p>

<p>Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun</p>

<p>O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set. Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.</p>

<p>9b6 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall! Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.</p>

<p>Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt, Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow; For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.</p>

<p>6j7 Morte d'Arthur</p>

<p>So all day long the noise of battle roll'd Among the mountains by the winter sea; Until King Arthur's table, man by man, Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their Lord, King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep, The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him, Sir Bedivere the last of all his knights, And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, A broken chancel with a broken cross, That stood on a dark strait of barren land. On one side lay the Ocean, and on one Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</p>

<p>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: "The sequel of to-day unsolders all The goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep They sleepthe men I loved. I think that we Shall never more, at any future time, Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, Walking about the gardens and the halls Of Camelot, as in the days that were. I perish by this people which I made, Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again To rule once morebut let what will be, be, I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm That without help I cannot last till morn. Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how In those old days, one summer noon, an arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</p>

<p>Holding the swordand how I row'd across</p>

<p>And took it, and have worn it, like a king:</p>

<p>And, wheresoever I am sung or told</p>

<p>In aftertime, this also shall be known:</p>

<p>But now delay not: take Excalibur,</p>

<p>And fling him far into the middle mere:</p>

<p>Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word."</p>

<p>To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere: "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus, Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. A little thing may harm a wounded man. Yet I thy hest will all perform at full, Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."</p>

<p>So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept And in the moon athwart the place of tombs, Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock, Came on the shining levels of the lake.</p>

<p>There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, This way and that dividing the swift mind, In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd There in the many-knotted waterflags, That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. So strode he back slow to the wounded King.</p>

<p>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"</p>

<p>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And the wild water lapping on the crag."</p>

<p>To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: For surer sign had follow'd, either hand, Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. This is a shameful thing for men to lie. Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."</p>

<p>Then went Sir Bedivere the second time Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought; But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, How curiously and strangely chased, he smote His palms together, and he cried aloud,</p>

<p>"And if indeed I cast the brand away, Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, Should thus be lost for ever from the earth, Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. What good should follow this, if this were done? What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, Seeing obedience is the bond of rule. Were it well to obey then, if a king demand An act unprofitable, against himself? The King is sick, and knows not what he does. What record, or what relic of my lord Should be to aftertime, but empty breath And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, Some one might show it at a joust of arms, Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake. Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases of the hills.' So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people, winning reverence. But now much honour and much fame were lost.</p>

<p>So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 9</p>

<p>And hid Excalibur the second time,</p>

<p>And so strode back slow to the wounded King.</p>

<p>Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"</p>

<p>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: "I heard the water lapping on the crag, And the long ripple washing in the reeds."</p>

<p>To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! Authority forgets a dying king, Laid widow'd of the power in his eye That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, In whom should meet the offices of all, Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; Either from lust of gold, or like a girl Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, And the third time may prosper, get thee hence. But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, I will arise and slay thee with my hands."</p>

<p>Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, Seen where the moving isles of winter shock By night, with noises of the northern sea. So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere. And lightly went the other to the King.</p>

<p>Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, So great a miracle as yonder hilt. Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; But when I look'd again, behold an arm, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere."</p>

<p>And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: "My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone. Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, And bear me to the margin; yet I fear My wound hath taken cold; and I shall die."</p>

<p>So saying, from the pavement he half rose, Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, And would have spoken, but he found not words, Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.</p>

<p>But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King, Muttering and murmuring at his ear, "Quick, quick I fear it is too late, and I shall die." But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, Clothed with his breath, and looking as he walk'd, Larger than human on the frozen hills. He heard the deep behind him, and a cry Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad. Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves And barren chasms, and all to left and right The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 991</p>

<p>And the long glories of the winter moon.</p>

<p>Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge, Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, Beneath them; and descending they were ware That all the decks were dense with stately forms Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dreamby these Three Queens with crowns of goldand from them rose A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, And, as it were one voice, an agony Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills All night in a waste land, where no one comes, Or hath come, since the making of the world.</p>

<p>Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge,"' And to the barge they came. There those three Queens Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. But she, that rose the tallest of them all And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, And call'd him by his name, complaining loud, And dropping bitter tears against his brow Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white And colourless, and like the wither'd moon Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls That made his forehead like a rising sun High from the dais-thronewere parch'd with dust; Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. So like a shatter'd column lay the King; Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, From spur to plume a star of tournament, Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.</p>

<p>Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere, "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? For now I see the true old times are dead, When every morning brought a noble chance, And every chance brought out a noble knight. Such times have been not since the light that led</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. But now the whole round table is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world; And I, the last, go forth companionless, And the days darken round me and the years, Among new men, strange faces, other minds."</p>

<p>And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: "The old order changeth, yielding place to new, And God fulfils Himself in many ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? I have lived my life, and that which I have done May He within Himself make pure! but thou, If thou shouldst never see my face again, Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day. For what are men better than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain, If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend ? For so the whole round earth is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. But now farewell. I am going a long way With these thou seestif indeed I go (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) To the island-valley of Avilion; Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies Deep-meadow'd happy, fair with orchard-lawns And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."</p>

<p>So said he, and the barge with oar and sail Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere Revolving many memories, till the hull Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn And on the mere the wailing died away.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>The Lotos-Eaters</p>

<p>"Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land, "This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon." In the afternoon they came unto a land In which it seemed always afternoon. All round the coast the languid air did swoon, Breathing like one that hath a weary dream. Full-faced above the valley stood the moon; And, like a downward smoke, the slender stream Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.</p>

<p>A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,</p>

<p>Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;</p>

<p>And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,</p>

<p>Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.</p>

<p>They saw the gleaming river seaward flow</p>

<p>From the inner land; far off, three mountain-tops,</p>

<p>Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,</p>

<p>Stood sunset-flush'd; and, dew'd with showery drops,</p>

<p>Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.</p>

<p>The charmed sunset linger'd low adowri</p>

<p>In the red West; thro' mountain clefts the dale</p>

<p>Was seen far inland, and the yellow down</p>

<p>Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale</p>

<p>And meadow, set with slender galingale;</p>

<p>A land where all things always seem'd the same!</p>

<p>And round about the keel with faces pale,</p>

<p>Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,</p>

<p>The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.</p>

<p>Branches they bore of that enchanted stem, Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave To each, but whoso did receive of them And taste, to him the gushing of the wave Far far away did seem to mourn and rave On alien shores; and if his fellow spake, His voice was thin, as voices from the grave; And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake, And music in his ears his beating heart did make.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>994</p>

<p>They sat them down upon the yellow sand, Between the sun and moon upon the shore; And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland, Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar, Weary the wandering fields of barren foam. Then some one said, "We will return no more;" And all at once they sang, "Our island home Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam."</p>

<p>choric song</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>There is sweet music here that softer falls Than petals from blown roses on the grass, Or night-dews on still waters between walls Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass; Music that gentlier on the spirit lies, Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes;</p>

<p>Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.</p>

<p>Here are cool mosses deep,</p>

<p>And thro' the moss the ivies creep,</p>

<p>And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,</p>

<p>And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.</p>

<p>n</p>

<p>Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness, And utterly consumed with sharp distress, While all things else have rest from weariness? All things have rest: why should we toil alone, We only toil, who are the first of things, And make perpetual moan, Still from one sorrow to another thrown; Nor ever fold our wings, And cease from wanderings, Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm; Nor harken what the inner spirit sings, "There is no joy but calm!"</p>

<p>Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>995</p>

<p>in</p>

<p>Lo! in the middle of the wood,</p>

<p>The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud</p>

<p>With winds upon the branch, and there</p>

<p>Grows green and broad, and takes no care,</p>

<p>Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon</p>

<p>Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow</p>

<p>Falls, and floats adown the air.</p>

<p>Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,</p>

<p>The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,</p>

<p>Drops in a silent autumn night.</p>

<p>All its allotted length of days</p>

<p>The flower ripens in its place,</p>

<p>Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil,</p>

<p>Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil.</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>Hateful is the dark-blue sky,</p>

<p>Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea.</p>

<p>Death is the end of life; ah, why</p>

<p>Should life all labor be?</p>

<p>Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast,</p>

<p>And in a little while our lips are dumb.</p>

<p>Let us alone. What is it that will last?</p>

<p>All things are taken from us, and become</p>

<p>Portions and parcels of the dreadful past.</p>

<p>Let us alone. What pleasure can we have</p>

<p>To war with evil ? Is there any peace</p>

<p>In ever climbing up the climbing wave?</p>

<p>All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave</p>

<p>In silenceripen, fall, and cease:</p>

<p>Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,</p>

<p>With half-shut eyes ever to seem</p>

<p>Falling asleep in a half-dream!</p>

<p>To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;</p>

<p>To hear each other's whisper'd speech;</p>

<p>Eating the Lotos day by day,</p>

<p>To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,</p>

<p>And tender curving lines of creamy spray;</p>

<p>To lend our hearts and spirits wholly</p>

<p>To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;</p>

<p>To muse and brood and live again in memory,</p>

<p>With those old faces of our infancy</p>

<p>Heap'd over with a mound of grass,</p>

<p>Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!</p>

<p>vi</p>

<p>Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,</p>

<p>And dear the last embraces of our wives</p>

<p>And their warm tears; but all hath suffer'd change;</p>

<p>For surely now our household hearths are cold,</p>

<p>Our sons inherit us, our looks are strange,</p>

<p>And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.</p>

<p>Or else the island princes over-bold</p>

<p>Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings</p>

<p>Before them of the ten years' war in Troy,</p>

<p>And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.</p>

<p>Is there confusion in the little isle?</p>

<p>Let what is broken so remain.</p>

<p>The Gods are hard to reconcile;</p>

<p>'Tis hard to settle order once again.</p>

<p>There is confusion worse than death,</p>

<p>Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,</p>

<p>Long labor unto aged breath,</p>

<p>Sore task to hearts worn out by many wars</p>

<p>And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.</p>

<p>vii</p>

<p>But, propped on beds of amaranth and moly,</p>

<p>How sweetwhile warm airs lull us, blowing lowly</p>

<p>With half-dropped eyelids still,</p>

<p>Beneath a heaven dark and holy,</p>

<p>To watch the long bright river drawing slowly</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 997</p>

<p>His waters from the purple hill</p>

<p>To hear the dewy echoes calling</p>

<p>From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine</p>

<p>To watch the emerald-color'd water falling</p>

<p>Thro' many a woven acanthus-wreath divine!</p>

<p>Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,</p>

<p>Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine.</p>

<p>vni</p>

<p>The Lotos blooms below the barren peak,</p>

<p>The Lotos blows by every winding creek;</p>

<p>All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone;</p>

<p>Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone</p>

<p>Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.</p>

<p>We have had enough of action, and of motion we, Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething free,</p>

<p>Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.</p>

<p>Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind, In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind. For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world; Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands, Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands,</p>

<p>Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and</p>

<p>praying hands. But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong; Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil; Till they perish and they suffersome, 'tis whisper'ddown in</p>

<p>hell</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell, Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel. Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore Than labor in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more.</p>

<p>You Ask Me, Why</p>

<p>You ask me, why, tho' ill at ease,</p>

<p>Within this region I subsist,</p>

<p>Whose spirits falter in the mist, And languish for the purple seas.</p>

<p>It is the land that freemen till, That sober-suited Freedom chose, The land, where girt with friends or foes</p>

<p>A man may speak the thing he will;</p>

<p>A land of settled government, A land of just and old renown, Where Freedom slowly broadens down</p>

<p>From precedent to precedent;</p>

<p>Where faction seldom gathers head, But, by degrees to fullness wrought, The strength of some diffusive thought</p>

<p>Hath time and space to work and spread.</p>

<p>Should banded unions persecute Opinions, and induce a time When single thought is civil crime,</p>

<p>And individual freedom mute,</p>

<p>Tho' power should make from land to land The name of Britain trebly great Tho' every channel of the State</p>

<p>Should fill and choke with golden sand</p>

<p>Yet waft me from the harbor-mouth,</p>

<p>Wild wind! I seek a warmer sky,</p>

<p>And I will see before I die The palms and temples of the South.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Love Thou Thy Land</p>

<p>Love thou thy land, with love far-brought From out the storied past, and used Within the present, but transfused</p>

<p>Thro' future time by power of thought;</p>

<p>True love turn'd round on fixed poles, Love, that endures not sordid ends, For English natures, freemen, friends,</p>

<p>Thy brothers, and immortal souls.</p>

<p>But pamper not a hasty time, Nor feed with crude imaginings The herd, wild hearts and feeble wings</p>

<p>That every sophister can lime.</p>

<p>Deliver not the tasks of might To weakness, neither hide the ray From those, not blind, who wait for day,</p>

<p>Tho' sitting girt with doubtful light.</p>

<p>Make knowledge circle with the winds;</p>

<p>But let her herald, Reverence, fly</p>

<p>Before her to whatever sky Bear seed of men and growth of minds.</p>

<p>Watch what main-currents draw the years: Cut Prejudice against the grain. But gentle words are always gain;</p>

<p>Regard the weakness of thy peers.</p>

<p>Nor toil for title, place, or touch Of pension, neither count on praise It grows to guerdon after-days.</p>

<p>Nor deal in watch-words overmuch;</p>

<p>Not clinging to some ancient saw, Not master'd by some modern term, Not swift nor slow to change, but firm;</p>

<p>And in its season bring the law,</p>

<p>1000 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>That from Discussion's lip may fall</p>

<p>With Life that, working strongly, binds Set in all lights by many minds,</p>

<p>To close the interests of all.</p>

<p>For Nature also, cold and warm, And moist and dry, devising long, Thro' many agents making strong,</p>

<p>Matures the individual form.</p>

<p>Meet is it changes should control Our being, lest we rust in ease. We all are changed by still degrees,</p>

<p>All but the basis of the soul.</p>

<p>So let the change which comes be free To ingroove itself with that which flies, And work, a joint of state, that plies</p>

<p>Its office, moved with sympathy.</p>

<p>A saying hard to shape in act; For all the past of Time reveals A bridal dawn of thunder-peals,</p>

<p>Wherever Thought hath wedded Fact.</p>

<p>Even now we hear with inward strife A motion toiling in the gloom The Spirit of the years to come</p>

<p>Yearning to mix himself with Life.</p>

<p>A slow-develop'd strength awaits Completion in a painful school; Phantoms of other forms of rule,</p>

<p>New Majesties of mighty States</p>

<p>The warders of the growing hour, But vague in vapor, hard to mark; And round them sea and air are dark</p>

<p>With great contrivances of Power.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IOOI</p>

<p>Of many changes, aptly join'd,</p>

<p>Is bodied forth the second whole.</p>

<p>Regard gradation, lest the soul Of Discord race the rising wind;</p>

<p>A wind to puff your idol-fires,</p>

<p>And heap their ashes on the head;</p>

<p>To shame the boast so often made, That we are wiser than our sires.</p>

<p>O, yet, if Nature's evil star</p>

<p>Drive men in manhood, as in youth,</p>

<p>To follow flying steps of Truth Across the brazen bridge of war</p>

<p>If New and Old, disastrous feud,</p>

<p>Must ever shock, like armed foes,</p>

<p>And this be true, till Time shall close That Principles are rain'd in blood;</p>

<p>Not yet the wise of heart would cease</p>

<p>To hold his hope thro' shame and guilt,</p>

<p>But with his hand against the hilt, Would pace the troubled land, like Peace;</p>

<p>Not less, tho' dogs of Faction bay,</p>

<p>Would serve his kind in deed and word, Certain, if knowledge bring the sword,</p>

<p>That knowledge takes the sword away</p>

<p>Would love the gleams of love that broke</p>

<p>From either side, nor veil his eyes;</p>

<p>And if some dreadful need should rise Would strike, and firmly, and one stroke.</p>

<p>To-morrow yet would reap to-day,</p>

<p>As we bear blossom of the dead;</p>

<p>Earn well the thrifty months, nor wed Raw Haste, half-sister to Delay.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Sir Galahad</p>

<p>My good blade carves the casques of men,</p>

<p>My tough lance thrusteth sure, My strength is as the strength of ten,</p>

<p>Because my heart is pure. The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,</p>

<p>The hard brands shiver on the steel, The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,</p>

<p>The horse and rider reel; They reel, they roll in clanging lists,</p>

<p>And when the tide of combat stands, Perfume and flowers fall in showers,</p>

<p>That lighdy rain from ladies' hands.</p>

<p>How sweet are looks that ladies bend</p>

<p>On whom their favors fall! For them I battle till the end,</p>

<p>To save from shame and thrall; But all my heart is drawn above,</p>

<p>My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine; I never felt the kiss of love,</p>

<p>Nor maiden's hand in mine. More bounteous aspects on me beam,</p>

<p>Me mightier transports move and thrill; So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer</p>

<p>A virgin heart in work and will.</p>

<p>When down the stormy crescent goes,</p>

<p>A light before me swims, Between dark stems the forest glows,</p>

<p>I hear a noise of hymns. Then by some secret shrine I ride;</p>

<p>I hear a voice, but none are there; The stalls are void, the doors are wide,</p>

<p>The tapers burning fair. Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,</p>

<p>The silver vessels sparkle clean, The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,</p>

<p>And solemn chants resound between.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IOO3</p>

<p>Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres</p>

<p>I find a magic bark. I leap on board; no helmsman steers;</p>

<p>I float till all is dark. A gentle sound, an awful light!</p>

<p>Three angels bear the Holy Grail; With folded feet, in stoles of white,</p>

<p>On sleeping wings they sail. Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!</p>

<p>My spirit beats her mortal bars, As down dark tides the glory slides,</p>

<p>And starlike mingles with the stars.</p>

<p>When on my goodly charger borne</p>

<p>Thro' dreaming towns I go, The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,</p>

<p>The streets are dumb with snow. The tempest crackles on the leads.</p>

<p>And, ringing, springs from brand and mail; But o'er the dark a glory spreads,</p>

<p>And gilds the driving hail. I leave the plain, I climb the height;</p>

<p>No branchy thicket shelter yields; But blessed forms in whistling storms</p>

<p>Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.</p>

<p>A maiden knightto me is given</p>

<p>Such hope, I know not fear; I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven</p>

<p>That often meet me here. I muse on joy that will not cease,</p>

<p>Pure spaces clothed in living beams, Pure lilies of eternal peace,</p>

<p>Whose odors haunt my dreams; And, stricken by an angel's hand,</p>

<p>This mortal armor that I wear, This weight and size, this heart and eyes,</p>

<p>Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air.</p>

<p>The clouds are broken in the sky, And thro' the mountain-walls</p>

<p>1004 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>A rolling organ-harmony</p>

<p>Swells up and shakes and falls. Then move the trees, the copses nod,</p>

<p>Wings flutter, voices hover clear: "O just and faithful knight of God!</p>

<p>Ride on! the prize is near." So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;</p>

<p>By bridge and ford, by park and pale, All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,</p>

<p>Until I find the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>6^2 The Higher Pantheism</p>

<p>The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and the plains, Are not these, O Soul, the Vision of Him, who reigns?</p>

<p>Is not the Vision He, tho' He be not that which He seems? Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?</p>

<p>Earth, these solid stars, this weight of body and limb, Are they not sign and symbol of thy division from Him ?</p>

<p>Dark is the world to thee; thyself art the reason why,</p>

<p>For is He not all but thou, that hast power to feel "I am I"?</p>

<p>Glory about thee, without thee; and thou fulfillest thy doom, Making Him broken gleams and a stifled splendor and gloom.</p>

<p>Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet.</p>

<p>God is law, say the wise; O Soul, and let us rejoice. For if He thunder by law the thunder is yet His voice.</p>

<p>Law is God, say some; no God at all, says the fool,</p>

<p>For all we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool;</p>

<p>And the ear of man cannot hear, and the eye of man cannot see; But if we could see and hear, this Vision-were it not He?</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>643 Flower in the Crannied Wall</p>

<p>Flower in the crannied wall,</p>

<p>I pluck you out of the crannies,</p>

<p>I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,</p>

<p>Little flowerbut if I could understand</p>

<p>What you are, root and all, and all in all,</p>

<p>I should know what God and man is.</p>

<p>644 Wages</p>

<p>Glory of warrior, glory of orator, glory of song,</p>

<p>Paid with a voice flying by to be lost on an endless sea</p>

<p>Glory of Virtue, to fight, to struggle, to right the wrong Nay, but she aim'd not at glory, no lover of glory she;</p>

<p>Give her the glory of going on, and still to be.</p>

<p>The wages of sin is death: if the wages of Virtue be dust, Would she have heart to endure for the life of the worm and the fly?</p>

<p>She desires no isles of the blest, no quiet seats of the just, To rest in a golden grove, or to bask in a summer sky;</p>

<p>Give her the wages of going on, and not to die.</p>

<p>645 The Charge of the Light Brigade</p>

<p>Half a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death</p>

<p>Rode the six hundred. "Forward the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!" he said. Into the valley of Death</p>

<p>Rode the six hundred.</p>

<p>"Forward, the Light Brigade!" Was there a man dismay'd ? Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd. Theirs not to make reply, Theirs not to reason why,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Theirs but to do and die. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.</p>

<p>Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them</p>

<p>Volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of hell</p>

<p>Rode the six hundred.</p>

<p>Flash'd all their sabres bare, Flash'd as they turn'd in air Sabring the gunners there, Charging an army, while</p>

<p>All the world wonder'd. Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro' the line they broke; Cossack and Russian Reel'd from the sabre-stroke</p>

<p>Shatter'd and sunder'd. Then they rode back, but not,</p>

<p>Not the six hundred.</p>

<p>Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon behind them</p>

<p>Volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, While horse and hero fell, They that had fought so well Came thro' the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of hell, All that was left of them,</p>

<p>Left of six hundred.</p>

<p>When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wonder'd.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>1007</p>

<p>Honor the charge they made I Honor the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred!</p>

<p>; The Revenge</p>

<p>A Ballad of the Fleet</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>At Flores, in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay, And a pinnace, like a flutter'd bird, came flying from far away; "Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!" Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: " 'Fore God I am no coward; But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear, And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick. We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?"</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: "I know you are no coward;</p>

<p>You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.</p>

<p>But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.</p>

<p>I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,</p>

<p>To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain."</p>

<p>hi</p>

<p>So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war that day,</p>

<p>Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;</p>

<p>But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land</p>

<p>Very carefully and slow,</p>

<p>Men of Bideford in Devon,</p>

<p>And we laid them on the ballast down below:</p>

<p>For we brought them all aboard,</p>

<p>And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain, To the thumb-screw and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.</p>

<p>rv</p>

<p>He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight, And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight, With his huge sea-casdes heaving upon the weather bow. "Shall we fight or shall we fly ? Good Sir Richard, tell us now, For to fight is but to die!</p>

<p>IOo8 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set." And Sir Richard said again: "We be all good Englishmen. Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil, For I never turn'd my back upon Don or devil yet."</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>Sir Richard spoke and he laugh'd, and we roar'd a hurrah and so The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe, With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below; For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen, And the little Revenge ran on thro' the long sea-lane between.</p>

<p>vi</p>

<p>Thousands of their soldiers look'd down from their decks and laugh'd, Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft Running on and on, till delay'd</p>

<p>By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons, And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns, Took the breath from our sails, and we stay'd.</p>

<p>vii</p>

<p>And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud</p>

<p>Whence the thunderbolt will fall</p>

<p>Long and loud,</p>

<p>Four galleons drew away</p>

<p>From the Spanish fleet that day.</p>

<p>And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay, And the battle-thunder broke from them all.</p>

<p>viii</p>

<p>But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went, Having that within her womb that had left her ill content; And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand, For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers, And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears When he leaps from the water to the land.</p>

<p>ix</p>

<p>And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,</p>

<p>But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IOO9</p>

<p>Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came, Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;</p>

<p>Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.</p>

<p>For some were sunk and many were shatter'd and so could fight us no more</p>

<p>God of battles, was ever a batde like this in the world before?</p>

<p>x</p>

<p>For he said, "Fight on! fight on!" Tho' his vessel was all but a wreck;</p>

<p>And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone, With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck, But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead, And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head, And he said, "Fight on! fight on!"</p>

<p>xi</p>

<p>And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer</p>

<p>sea,</p>

<p>And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring; But they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that we still could sting,</p>

<p>So they watch'd what the end would be. And we had not fought them in vain, But in perilous plight were we, Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain, And half of the rest of us maim'd for life In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife; And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,</p>

<p>And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;</p>

<p>And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;</p>

<p>But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:</p>

<p>"We have fought such a fight for a day and a night</p>

<p>As may never be fought again!</p>

<p>We have won great glory, my men!</p>

<p>And a day less or more</p>

<p>1010 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>At sea or ashore,</p>

<p>We diedoes it matter when ?</p>

<p>Sink me the ship, Master Gunnersink her, split her in twain! Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!"</p>

<p>xii</p>

<p>And the gunner said, "Ay, ay," but the seamen made reply: "We have children, we have wives, And the Lord hath spared our lives.</p>

<p>We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go; We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow." And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.</p>

<p>xiii</p>

<p>And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then, Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last, And they praised him to his face with their courdy foreign grace; But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:</p>

<p>"I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true; I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do. With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!" And he fell upon their decks, and he died.</p>

<p>xiv</p>

<p>And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true, And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap That he dared her with one little ship and his English few; Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew, But they sank his body with honor down into the deep. And they mann'd the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew, And away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own; When a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep, And the water began to heave and the weather to moan, And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew, And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew, Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,</p>

<p>And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy of Spain,</p>

<p>And the litde Revenge herself went down by the island crags To be lost evermore in the main.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Wailing, wailing, wailing, the wind over land and sea And Willy's voice in the wind, "O mother, come out to me!" Why should he call me to-night, when he knows that I cannot go? For the downs are as bright as day, and the full moon stares at the snow.</p>

<p>We should be seen, my dear; they would spy us out of the town. The loud black nights for us, and the storm rushing over the down, When I cannot see my own hand, but am led by the creak of the chain, And grovel and grope for my son till I find myself drenched with the rain.</p>

<p>Anything fallen again? naywhat was there left to fall? I have taken them home, I have number'd the bones, I have hidden them all.</p>

<p>What am I saying? and what are you? do you come as a spy? Falls? what falls? who knows? As the tree falls so must it lie.</p>

<p>Who let her in? how long has she been? youwhat have you heard?</p>

<p>Why did you sit so quiet? you never have spoken a word.</p>

<p>Oto pray with meyesa ladynone of their spies</p>

<p>But the night has crept into my heart, and begun to darken my eyes.</p>

<p>Ahyou, that lived so soft, what should you know of the night, The blast and the burning shame and the bitter frost and the fright? I have done it, while you were asleepyou were only made for the day.</p>

<p>I have gather'd my baby togetherand now you may go your way.</p>

<p>Nayfor it's kind of you, madam, to sit by an old dying wife. But say nothing hard of my boy, I have only an hour of life. I kiss'd my boy in the prison, before he went out to die. "They dared me to do it," he said, and he never has told me a lie.</p>

<p>I whipped him for robbing an orchard once when he was but a child "The farmer dared me to do it," he said; he was always so wild</p>

<p>1012 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And idleand couldn't be idlemy Willyhe never could rest. The King should have made him a soldier, he would have been one of his best.</p>

<p>But he lived with a lot of wild mates, and they never would let him be good;</p>

<p>They swore that he dare not rob the mail, and he swore that he would; And he took no life, but he took one purse, and when all was done He flung it among his fellows"I'll none of it," said my son.</p>

<p>I came into court to the judge and the lawyers. I told them my tale, God's own truthbut they kill'd him, they kill'd him for robbing the mail.</p>

<p>They hang'd him in chains for a showwe had always borne a good name</p>

<p>To be hang'd for a thiefand then put awayisn't that enough shame?</p>

<p>Dust to dustlow downlet us hide! but they set him so high That all the ships of the world could stare at him, passing by. God'll pardon the hell-black raven and horrible fowls of the air, But not the black heart of the lawyer who kill'd him and hang'd him there.</p>

<p>And the jailer forced me away. I had bid him my last good-bye; They had fasten'd the door of his cell. "O mother!" I heard him cry. I couldn't get back tho' I tried, he had something further to say, And now I never shall know it. The jailer forced me away.</p>

<p>Then since I couldn't but hear that cry of my boy that was dead, They seized me and shut me up: they fasten'd me down on my bed. "Mother, O mother!"he call'd in the dark to me year after year They beat me for that, they beat meyou know that I couldn't but hear;</p>

<p>And then at the last they found I had grown so stupid and still They let me abroad againbut the creatures had worked their will.</p>

<p>Flesh of my flesh was gone, but bone of my bone was left I stole them all from the lawyersand you, will you call it a theft? My baby, the bones that had suck'd me, the bones that had laughed and had cried</p>

<p>Theirs? O, no! they are minenot theirsthey had moved in my side.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 1013</p>

<p>Do you think I was scared by the bones? I kiss'd 'em, I buried 'em all</p>

<p>I can't dig deep, I am oldin the night by the churchyard wall. My Willy'11 rise up whole when the trumpet of judgment'll sound, But I charge you never to say that I laid him in holy ground.</p>

<p>They would scratch him upthey would hang him again on the cursed tree.</p>

<p>Sin? O, yes, we are sinners, I knowlet all that be,</p>

<p>And read me a Bible verse of the Lord's goodwill toward men</p>

<p>"Full of compassion and mercy, the Lord"let me hear it again;</p>

<p>"Full of compassion and mercylong-suffering." Yes, O, yes!</p>

<p>For the lawyer is born but to murderthe Saviour lives but to bless.</p>

<p>He'll never put on the black cap except for the worst of the worst, And the first may be lastI have heard it in churchand the last may be first.</p>

<p>SufferingO, long-suffering-yes, as the Lord must know,</p>

<p>Year after year in the mist and the wind and the shower and the snow.</p>

<p>Heard, have you? what? they have told you he never repented his sin.</p>

<p>How do they know it? are they his mother? are you of his kin? Heard! have you ever heard, when the storm on the downs began, The wind that'll wail like a child and the sea that'll moan like a man?</p>

<p>Election, Election, and Reprobationit's all very well.</p>

<p>But I go to-night to my boy, and I shall not find him in Hell.</p>

<p>For I cared so much for my boy that the Lord has look'd into my care,</p>

<p>And He means me I'm sure to be happy with Willy, I know not where.</p>

<p>And if he be lostbut to save my soul, that is all your desire Do you think that I care for my soul if my boy be gone to the fire? I have been with God in the darkgo, go, you may leave me alone You never have borne a childyou are just as hard as a stone.</p>

<p>Madam, I beg your pardon! I think that you mean to be kind, But I cannot hear what you say for my Willy's voice in the wind The snow and the sky so brighthe used but to call in the dark, And he calls to me now from the church and not from the gibbet for hark!</p>

<p>1014 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Nayyou can hear it yourselfit is comingshaking the walls Willythe moon's in a cloudGood-night. I am going. He calls.</p>

<p>648 To Virgil</p>

<p>Roman Virgil, thou that singest Ilion's lofty temples robed in fire, Ilion falling, Rome arising, wars, and filial faith, and Dido's pyre;</p>

<p>Landscape-lover, lord of language more than he that sang the "Works and Days,"</p>

<p>All the chosen coin of fancy flashing out from many a golden phrase;</p>

<p>Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd;</p>

<p>All the charm of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word;</p>

<p>Poet of the happy Tityrus piping underneath his beechen bowers; Poet of the poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers;</p>

<p>Chanter of the Pollio, glorying in the blissful years again to be, Summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earth and oarless sea;</p>

<p>Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind; Thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind;</p>

<p>Light among the vanish'd ages; star that gildest yet this phantom shore;</p>

<p>Golden branch amid the shadows, kings and realms that pass to rise no more;</p>

<p>Now thy Forum roars no longer, fallen every purple Caesar's dome Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm sound forever of Imperial Rome</p>

<p>Now the Rome of slaves hath perish'd, and the Rome of freemen holds her place,</p>

<p>I, from out the Northern Islands sunder'd once from all the human race,</p>

<p>I salute thee, Mantovano, I that loved thee since my day began, Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>649 Maud</p>

<p>Part I I 1</p>

<p>I hate the dreadful hollow behind the little wood, Its lips in the field above are dabbled with blood-red heath, The red-ribb'd ledges drip with a silent horror of blood, And Echo there, whatever is ask'd her, answers "Death."</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>For there in the ghastly pit long since a body was found, His who had given me lifeO father! O God! was it well? Mangled, and flatten'd, and crush'd, and dinted into the ground: There yet lies the rock that fell with him when he fell.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Did he fling himself down? who knows? for a vast speculation had fail'd,</p>

<p>And ever he mutter'd and madden'd, and ever wann'd with despair, And out he walk'd when the wind like a broken worldling wail'd, And the flying gold of the ruin'd woodlands drove thro' the air.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>I remember the time, for the roots of my hair were stirr'd By a shuffled step, by a dead weight trail'd, by a whisper'd fright, And my pulses closed their gates with a shock on my heart as I heard The shrill-edged shriek of a mother divide the shuddering night.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Villainy somewhere! whose? One says, we are villains all. Not he: his honest fame should at least by me be maintain'd: But that old man, now lord of the broad estate and the Hall, Dropt off gorged from a scheme that had left us flaccid and drain'd.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Why do they prate of the blessings of Peace? we have made them a curse,</p>

<p>Pickpockets, each hand lusting for all that is not its own;</p>

<p>I0l6 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And lust of gain, in the spirit of Cain, is it better or worse</p>

<p>Than the heart of the citizen hissing in war on his own hearthstone?</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>But these are the days of advance, the works of the men of mind, When who but a fool would have faith in a tradesman's ware or his word ?</p>

<p>Is it peace or war? Civil war, as I think, and that of a kind The viler, as underhand, not openly bearing the sword.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Sooner or later I too may passively take the print</p>

<p>Of the golden agewhy not? I have neither hope nor trust;</p>

<p>May make my heart as a millstone, set my face as a flint,</p>

<p>Cheat and be cheated, and die: who knows? we are ashes and dust.</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Peace sitting under her olive, and slurring the days gone by, When the poor are hovell'd and hustled together, each sex, like swine, When only the ledger lives, and when only not all men lie; Peace in her vineyardyes!but a company forges the wine.</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>And the vitriol madness flushes up in the ruffian's head, Till the filthy by-lane rings to the yell of the trampled wife, And chalk and alum and plaster are sold to the poor for bread, And the spirit of murder works in the very means of life.</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>And Sleep must lie down arm'd, for the villainous center-bits Grind on the wakeful ear in the hush of the moonless nights, While another is cheating the sick of a few last gasps, as he sits To pestle a poison'd poison behind his crimson lights.</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>When a Mammonite mother kills her babe for a burial fee, And Timour-Mammon grins on a pile of children's bones, Is it peace or war? better, war! loud war by land and by sea, War with a thousand battles, and shaking a hundred thrones.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>r3</p>

<p>For I trust if an enemy's fleet came yonder round by the hill, And the rushing battle-bolt sang from the three-decker out of the foam,</p>

<p>That the smoothfaced snubnosed rogue would leap from his counter and till,</p>

<p>And strike, if he could, were it but with his cheating yard-wand, home.</p>

<p>r4</p>

<p>What! am I raging alone as my father raged in his mood? Must / too creep to the hollow and dash myself down and die Rather than hold by the law that I made, nevermore to brood On a horror of shatter'd limbs and a wretched swindler's lie?</p>

<p>15</p>

<p>Would there be sorrow for me? there was love in the passionate shriek, Love for the silent thing that had made false haste to the grave Wrapt in a cloak, as I saw him, and thought he would rise and speak And rave at the lie and the liar, ah God, as he used to rave.</p>

<p>16</p>

<p>I am sick of the Hall and the hill, I am sick of the moor and the main. Why should I stay? can a sweeter chance ever come to me here? O, having the nerves of motion as well as the nerves of pain, Were it not wise if I fled from the place and the pit and the fear ?</p>

<p>Workmen up at the Hall!they are coming back from abroad; The dark old place will be gilt by the touch of a millionnaire: I have heard, I know not whence, of the singular beauty of Maud; I play'd with the girl when a child; she promised then to be fair.</p>

<p>18</p>

<p>Maud with her venturous climbings and tumbles and childish escapes, Maud the delight of the village, the ringing joy of the Hall, Maud with her sweet purse-mouth when my father dangled the grapes, Maud the beloved of my mother, the moon-faced darling of all,</p>

<p>ioi8</p>

<p>alfred, lord tennyson</p>

<p>19</p>

<p>What is she now? My dreams are bad. She may bring me a curse. No, there is fatter game on the moor; she will let me alone. Thanks, for the fiend best knows whether woman or man be the worse.</p>

<p>I will bury myself in myself, and the Devil may pipe to his own.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Long have I sigh'd for a calm: God grant I may find it at last!</p>

<p>It will never be broken by Maud, she has neither savour nor salt,</p>

<p>But a cold and clear-cut face, as I found when her carriage past,</p>

<p>Perfectly beautiful: let it be granted her: where is the fault?</p>

<p>All that I saw (for her eyes were downcast, not to be seen)</p>

<p>Faultily fauldess, icily regular, splendidly null,</p>

<p>Dead perfection, no more; nothing more, if it had not been</p>

<p>For a chance of travel, a paleness, an hour's defect of the rose,</p>

<p>Or an underlip, you may call it a little too ripe, too full,</p>

<p>Or the least little delicate aquiline curve in a sensitive nose,</p>

<p>From which I escaped heart-free, with the least little touch of spleen.</p>

<p>Ill</p>

<p>Cold and clear-cut face, why come you so cruelly meek, Breaking a slumber in which all spleenful folly was drown'd, Pale with the golden beam of an eyelash dead on the cheek, Passionless, pale, cold face, star-sweet on a gloom profound; Womanlike, taking revenge too deep for a transient wrong Done but in thought to your beauty, and ever as pale as before Growing and fading and growing upon me without a sound, Luminous, gemlike, ghostlike, deathlike, half the night long Growing and fading and growing, till I could bear it no more, But arose, and all by myself in my own dark garden ground, Listening now to the tide in its broad-flung ship-wrecking roar, Now to the scream of a madden'd beach dragg'd down by the wave, Walk'd in a wintry wind by a ghastly glimmer, and found The shining daffodil dead, and Orion low in his grave.</p>

<p>IV 1</p>

<p>A million emeralds break from the ruby-budded lime In the little grove where I sitah, wherefore cannot I be</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 1019</p>

<p>Like things of the season gay, like the bountiful season bland, When the far-off sail is blown by the breeze of a softer clime, Half-lost in the liquid azure bloom of a crescent of sea, The silent sapphire-spangled marriage ring of the land?</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Below me, there, is the village, and looks how quiet and small! And yet bubbles o'er like a city, with gossip, scandal, and spite; And Jack on his ale-house bench has as many lies as a Czar; And here on the landward side, by a red rock, glimmers the Hall; And up in the high Hall-garden I see her pass like a light; But sorrow seize me if ever that light be my leading star!</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>When have I bow'd to her father, the wrinkled head of the race? I met her to-day with her brother, but not to her brother I bow'd; I bow'd to his lady-sister as she rode by on the moor; But the fire of a foolish pride flash'd over her beautiful face.</p>

<p>0 child, you wrong your beauty, believe it, in being so proud; Your father has wealth well-gotten, and I am nameless and poor.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>1 keep but a man and a maid, ever ready to slander and steal; I know it, and smile a hard-set smile, like a stoic, or like</p>

<p>A wiser epicurean, and let the world have its way:</p>

<p>For nature is one with rapine, a harm no preacher can heal;</p>

<p>The Mayfly is torn by the swallow, the sparrow spear'd by the shrike.</p>

<p>And the whole litde wood where I sit is a world of plunder and prey.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>We are puppets, Man in his pride, and Beauty fair in her flower;</p>

<p>Do we move ourselves, or are we moved by an unseen hand at a game</p>

<p>That pushes us off from the board, and others ever succeed?</p>

<p>Ah yet, we cannot be kind to each other here for an hour;</p>

<p>We whisper, and hint, and chuckle, and grin at a brother's shame;</p>

<p>However we brave it out, we men are a little breed.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>A monstrous eft was of old the Lord and Master of Earth, For him did his high sun flame, and his river billowing ran,</p>

<p>1020 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And he felt himself in his force to be Nature's crowning race. As nine months go to the shaping an infant ripe for his birth, So many a million of ages have gone to the making of man: He now is first, but is he the last? is he not too base?</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>The man of science himself is fonder of glory, and vain, An eye well-practised in nature, a spirit bounded and poor; The passionate heart of the poet is whirl'd into folly and vice. I would not marvel at either, but keep a temperate brain; For not to desire or admire, if a man could learn it, were more Than to walk all day like the sultan of old in a garden of spice.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the veil.</p>

<p>Who knows the ways of the world, how God will bring them about?</p>

<p>Our planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide.</p>

<p>Shall I weep if a Poland fall ? shall I shriek if a Hungary fail ?</p>

<p>Or an infant civilisation be ruled with rod or with knout?</p>

<p>I have not made the world, and He that made it will guide.</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Be mine a philosopher's life in the quiet woodland ways, Where if I cannot be gay let a passionless peace be my lot, Far-off from the clamour of liars belied in the hubbub of lies; From the long-neck'd geese of the world that are ever hissing dispraise Because their natures are litde, and, whether he heed it or not, Where each man walks with his head in a cloud of poisonous flies.</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>And most of all would I flee from the cruel madness of love, The honey of poison-flowers and all the measureless ill. Ah Maud, you milkwhite fawn, you are all unmeet for a wife. Your mother is mute in her grave as her image in marble above; Your father is ever in London, you wander about at your will; You have but fed on the roses, and lain in the lilies of life.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>1021</p>

<p>V i</p>

<p>A voice by the cedar tree,</p>

<p>In the meadow under the Hall!</p>

<p>She is singing an air that is known to me,</p>

<p>A passionate ballad gallant and gay,</p>

<p>A martial song like a trumpet's call!</p>

<p>Singing alone in the morning of life,</p>

<p>In the happy morning of life and of May,</p>

<p>Singing of men that in battle array,</p>

<p>Ready in heart and ready in hand,</p>

<p>March with banner and bugle and fife</p>

<p>To the death, for their native land.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Maud with her exquisite face, And wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky, And feet like sunny gems on an English green, Maud in the light of her youth and her grace, Singing of Death, and of Honour that cannot die, Till I well could weep for a time so sordid and mean, And myself so languid and base.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Silence, beautiful voice!</p>

<p>Be still, for you only trouble the mind</p>

<p>With a joy in which I cannot rejoice,</p>

<p>A glory I shall not find.</p>

<p>Still! I will hear you no more,</p>

<p>For your sweetness hardly leaves me a choice</p>

<p>But to move to the meadow and fall before</p>

<p>Her feet on the meadow grass, and adore,</p>

<p>Not her, who is neither courtly nor kind</p>

<p>Not her, not her, but a voice.</p>

<p>VI i</p>

<p>Morning arises stormy and pale,</p>

<p>No sun, but a wannish glare</p>

<p>In fold upon fold of hueless cloud,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And the budded peaks of the wood are bow'd Caught and cuff'd by the gale: I had fancied it would be fair.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Whom but Maud should I meet</p>

<p>Last night, when the sunset burn'd</p>

<p>On the blossom'd gable-ends</p>

<p>At the head of the village street,</p>

<p>Whom but Maud should I meet?</p>

<p>And she touch'd my hand with a smile so sweet</p>

<p>She made me divine amends</p>

<p>For a courtesy not return'd.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>And thus a delicate spark</p>

<p>Of glowing and growing light</p>

<p>Thro' the livelong hours of the dark</p>

<p>Kept itself warm in the heart of my dreams,</p>

<p>Ready to burst in a colour'd flame;</p>

<p>Till at last when the morning came</p>

<p>In a cloud, it faded, and seems</p>

<p>But an ashen-gray delight.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>What if with her sunny hair,</p>

<p>And smile as sunny as cold,</p>

<p>She meant to weave me a snare</p>

<p>Of some coquettish deceit,</p>

<p>Cleopatra-like as of old</p>

<p>To entangle me when we met,</p>

<p>To have her lion roll in a silken net</p>

<p>And fawn at a victor's feet.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Ah, what shall I be at fifty Should Nature keep me alive, If I find the world so bitter When I am but twenty-five? Yet, if she were not a cheat,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 1023</p>

<p>If Maud were all that she seem'd, And her smile were all that I dream'd, Then the world were not so bitter But a smile could make it sweet.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>What if tho' her eye seem'd full Of a kind intent to me, What if that dandy-despot, he, That jewell'd mass of millinery, That oil'd and curl'd Assyrian Bull Smelling of musk and of insolence, Her brother, from whom I keep aloof, Who wants the finer politic sense To mask, tho' but in his own behoof, With a glassy smile his brutal scorn What if he had told her yestermorn How prettily for his own sweet sake A face of tenderness might be feign'd, And a moist mirage in desert eyes, That so, when the rotten hustings shake In another month to his brazen lies, A wretched vote may be gain'd.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>For a raven ever croaks, at my side,</p>

<p>Keep watch and ward, keep watch and ward,</p>

<p>Or thou wilt prove their tool.</p>

<p>Yea too, myself from myself I guard,</p>

<p>For often a man's own angry pride</p>

<p>Is cap and bells for a fool.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Perhaps the smile and tender tone Came out of her pitying womanhood, For am I not, am I not, here alone So many a summer since she died, My mother, who was so gentle and good? Living alone in an empty house, Here half-hid in the gleaming wood,</p>

<p>1024 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Where I hear the dead at midday moan,</p>

<p>And the shrieking rush of the wainscot mouse,</p>

<p>And my own sad name in corners cried,</p>

<p>When the shiver of dancing leaves is thrown</p>

<p>About its echoing chambers wide,</p>

<p>Till a morbid hate and horror have grown-</p>

<p>Of a world in which I have hardly mixt,</p>

<p>And a morbid eating lichen fixt</p>

<p>On a heart half-turn'd to stone.</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>0 heart of stone, are you flesh, and caught By that you swore to withstand?</p>

<p>For what was it else within me wrought But, I fear, the new strong wine of love, That made my tongue so stammer and trip When I saw the treasured splendour, her hand, Come sliding out of her sacred glove, And the sunlight broke from her lip?</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>1 have play'd with her when a child; She remembers it now we meet.</p>

<p>Ah well, well, well, I may be beguiled</p>

<p>By some coquettish deceit.</p>

<p>Yet, if she were not a cheat,</p>

<p>If Maud were all that she seem'd,</p>

<p>And her smile had all that I dream'd,</p>

<p>Then the world were not so bitter</p>

<p>But a smile could make it sweet.</p>

<p>VII i</p>

<p>Did I hear it half in a doze</p>

<p>Long since, I know not where?</p>

<p>Did I dream it an hour ago, When asleep in this arm-chair?</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Men were drinking together, Drinking and talking of me;</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON 1025</p>

<p>"Well, if it prove a girl, the boy Will have plenty: so let it be."</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Is it an echo of something</p>

<p>Read with a boy's delight, Viziers nodding together</p>

<p>In some Arabian night?</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Strange, that I hear two men,</p>

<p>Somewhere, talking of me; "Well, if it prove a girl, my boy</p>

<p>Will have plenty: so let it be."</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>She came to the village church,</p>

<p>And sat by a pillar alone;</p>

<p>An angel watching an urn</p>

<p>Wept over her, carved in stone;</p>

<p>And once, but once, she lifted her eyes,</p>

<p>And suddenly, sweet, strangely blush'd</p>

<p>To find they were met by my own;</p>

<p>And suddenly, sweetly, my heart beat stronger</p>

<p>And thicker, until I heard no longer</p>

<p>The snowy-banded, dilettante,</p>

<p>Delicate-handed priest intone;</p>

<p>And thought, is it pride, and mused and sigh'd</p>

<p>"No surely, now it cannot be pride."</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>I was walking a mile,</p>

<p>More than a mile from the shore,</p>

<p>The sun look'd out with a smile</p>

<p>Betwixt the cloud and the moor,</p>

<p>And riding at set of day</p>

<p>Over the dark moor land,</p>

<p>Rapidly riding far away,</p>

<p>She waved to me with her hand.</p>

<p>There were two at her side,</p>

<p>1026 alfred, lord tennyson</p>

<p>Something flash'd in the sun, Down by the hill I saw them ride, In a moment they were gone: Like a sudden spark Struck vainly in the night, Then returns the dark With no more hope of light.</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>Sick, am I sick of a jealous dread?</p>

<p>Was not one of the two at her side</p>

<p>This new-made lord, whose splendour plucks</p>

<p>The slavish hat from the villager's head?</p>

<p>Whose old grandfather has lately died,</p>

<p>Gone to a blacker pit, for whom</p>

<p>Grimy nakedness dragging his trucks</p>

<p>And laying his trams in a poison'd gloom</p>

<p>Wrought, till he crept from a gutted mine</p>

<p>Master of half a servile shire,</p>

<p>And left his coal all turn'd into gold</p>

<p>To a grandson, first of his noble line,</p>

<p>Rich in the grace all women desire,</p>

<p>Strong in the power that all men adore,</p>

<p>And simper and set their voices lower,</p>

<p>And soften as if to a girl, and hold</p>

<p>Awe-stricken breaths at a work divine,</p>

<p>Seeing his gewgaw castle shine,</p>

<p>New as his title, built last year,</p>

<p>There amid perky larches and pine,</p>

<p>And over the sullen-purple moor</p>

<p>(Look at it) pricking a cockney ear.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>What, has he found my jewel out? For one of the two that rode at her side Bound for the Hall, I am sure was he: Bound for the Hall, and I think for a bride. Blithe would her brother's acceptance be. Maud could be gracious too, no doubt,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO27</p>

<p>To a lord, a captain, a padded shape, A bought commission, a waxen face, A rabbit mouth that is ever agape Bought? what is it he cannot buy? And therefore splenetic, personal, base, A wounded thing with a rancorous cry, At war with myself and a wretched race. Sick, sick to the heart of life, am I.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Last week came one to the county town, To preach our poor little army down, And play the game of the despot kings, Tho' the state has done it and thrice as well: This broad-brimm'd hawker of holy things, Whose ear is stuff'd with his cotton, and rings Even in dreams to the chink of his pence, This huckster put down war! can he tell Whether war be a cause or a consequence? Put down the passions that make earth Helll Down with ambition, avarice, pride, Jealousy, down! cut off from the mind The bitter springs of anger and fear; Down too, down at your own fireside, With the evil tongue, and the evil ear, For each is at war with mankind.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>I wish I could hear again</p>

<p>The chivalrous battle-song</p>

<p>That she warbled alone in her joyl</p>

<p>I might persuade myself then</p>

<p>She would not do herself this great wrong,</p>

<p>To take a wanton dissolute boy</p>

<p>For a man and leader of men.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Ah God, for a man with heart, head, hand, Like some of the simple great ones gone For ever and ever by,</p>

<p>1028 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>One still strong man in a blatant land, Whatever they call him, what care I, Aristocrat, democrat, plutocratone Who can rule and dare not lie.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>And ah for a man to rise in me, That the man I am may cease to be!</p>

<p>XI i</p>

<p>0 let the solid ground Not fail beneath my feet</p>

<p>Before my life has found</p>

<p>What some have found so sweet; Then let come what come may, What matter if I go mad,</p>

<p>1 shall have had my day.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Let the sweet heavens endure,</p>

<p>Not close and darken above me Before I am quite sure</p>

<p>That there is one to love me; Then let come what come may To a life that has been so sad, I shall have had my day.</p>

<p>XII i</p>

<p>Birds in the high Hall-garden When twilight was falling,</p>

<p>Maud, Maud, Maud, Maud,</p>

<p>They were crying and calling.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Where was Maud? in our wood;</p>

<p>And I, who else, was with her, Gathering woodland lilies,</p>

<p>Myriads blow together.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>1029</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Birds in our wood sang</p>

<p>Ringing thro' the valleys,</p>

<p>Maud is here, here, here In among the lilies.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>I kiss'd her slender hand,</p>

<p>She took the kiss sedately;</p>

<p>Maud is not seventeen,</p>

<p>But she is tall and stately.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>I to cry out on pride</p>

<p>Who have won her favour!</p>

<p>0 Maud were sure of Heaven</p>

<p>If lowliness could save her.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>1 know the way she went</p>

<p>Home with her maiden posy, For her feet have touch'd the meadows And left the daisies rosy.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Birds in the high Hall-garden</p>

<p>Were crying and calling to her,</p>

<p>Where is Maud, Maud, Maud? One is come to woo her.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Look, a horse at the door,</p>

<p>And little King Charles is snarling, Go back, my lord, across the moor,</p>

<p>You are not her darling.</p>

<p>XIII 1</p>

<p>Scorn'd, to be scorn'd by one that I scorn, Is that a matter to make me fret?</p>

<p>IO3O ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>That a calamity hard to be borne?</p>

<p>Well, he may live to hate me yet.</p>

<p>Fool that I am to be vext with his pride!</p>

<p>I past him, I was crossing his lands;</p>

<p>He stood on the path a little aside;</p>

<p>His face, as I grant, in spite of spite</p>

<p>Has a broad-blown comeliness, red and white,</p>

<p>And six feet two, as I think, he stands;</p>

<p>But his essences turn'd the live air sick,</p>

<p>And barbarous opulence jewel-thick</p>

<p>Sunn'd itself on his breast and his hands.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Who shall call me ungentle, unfair, I long'd so heartily then and there To give him the grasp of fellowship; But while I past he was humming an air, Stopt, and then with a riding whip Leisurely tapping a glossy boot, And curving a contumelious lip, Gorgonised me from head to foot With a stony British stare.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Why sits he here in his father's chair? That old man never comes to his place: Shall I believe him ashamed to be seen? For only once, in the village street, Last year, I caught a glimpse of his face, A gray old wolf and a lean. Scarcely, now, would I call him a cheat: For then, perhaps, as a child of deceit, She might by a true descent be untrue; And Maud is as true as Maud is sweet: Tho' I fancy her sweetness only due To the sweeter blood by the other side; Her mother has been a thing complete, However she came to be so allied. And fair without, faithful within, Maud to him is nothing akin:</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO3I</p>

<p>Some peculiar mystic grace Made her only the child of her mother, And heap'd the whole inherited sin On that huge scapegoat of the race, All, all upon the brother.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Peace, angry spirit, and let him be! Has not his sister smiled on me?</p>

<p>XIV 1</p>

<p>Maud has a garden of roses And lilies fair on a lawn; There she walks in her state And tends upon bed and bower, And thither I climb'd at dawn And stood by her garden-gate; A lion ramps at the top, He is daspt by a passion-flower.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Maud's own little oak-room</p>

<p>(Which Maud, like a precious stone</p>

<p>Set in the heart of the carven gloom,</p>

<p>Lights with herself, when alone</p>

<p>She sits by her music and books,</p>

<p>And her brother lingers late</p>

<p>Withja roystering company) looks</p>

<p>Upon Maud's own garden gate:</p>

<p>And I thought as I stood, if a hand, as white</p>

<p>As ocean-foam in the moon, were laid</p>

<p>On the hasp of the window, and my Delight</p>

<p>Had a sudden desire, like a glorious ghost, to glide,</p>

<p>Like a beam of the seventh Heaven, down to my side,</p>

<p>There were but a step to be made.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>The fancy flatter'd my mind, And again seem'd overbold;</p>

<p>1032 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Now I thought that she cared for me, Now I thought she was kind Only because she was cold.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>I heard no sound where I stood But the rivulet on from the lawn Running down to my own dark wood; Or the voice of the long sea-wave as it swell'd Now and then in the dim-gray dawn; But I look'd, and round, all round the house I beheld The death-white curtain drawn; Felt a horror over me creep, Prickle my skin and catch my breath, Knew that the death-white curtain meant but sleep, Yet I shudder'd and thought like a fool of the sleep of death.</p>

<p>XV</p>

<p>So dark a mind within me dwells,</p>

<p>And I make myself such evil cheer, That if / be dear to some one else</p>

<p>Then some one else may have much to fear; But if / be dear to some one else,</p>

<p>Then I should be to myself more dear. Shall I not take care of all that I think, Yea ev'n of wretched meat and drink, If I be dear,</p>

<p>If I be dear to some one else.</p>

<p>XVI 1</p>

<p>This lump of earth has left his estate</p>

<p>The lighter by the loss of his weight;</p>

<p>And so that he find what he went to seek,</p>

<p>And fulsome Pleasure clog him, and drown</p>

<p>His heart in the gross mud-honey of town,</p>

<p>He may stay for a year who has gone for a week.</p>

<p>But this is the day when I must speak,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO33</p>

<p>And I see my Oread coming down, O this is the day!</p>

<p>0 beautiful creature, what am I That I dare to look her way; Think I may hold dominion sweet,</p>

<p>Lord of the pulse that is lord of her breast, And dream of her beauty with tender dread, From the delicate Arab arch of her feet To the grace that, bright and light as the crest Of a peacock, sits on her shining head, And she knows it not: O, if she knew it, To know her beauty might half undo it.</p>

<p>1 know it the one bright thing to save My yet young life in the wilds of Time, Perhaps from madness, perhaps from crime, Perhaps from a selfish grave.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>What, if she be fasten'd to this fool lord,</p>

<p>Dare I bid her abide by her word?</p>

<p>Should I love her so well if she</p>

<p>Had given her word to a thing so low?</p>

<p>Shall I love her as well if she</p>

<p>Can break her word were it even for me?</p>

<p>I trust that it is not so.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Catch not my breath, O clamorous heart, Let not my tongue be a thrall to my eye For I must tell her before we part, I must tell her, or die.</p>

<p>XVII</p>

<p>Go not, happy day,</p>

<p>From the shining fields, Go not, happy day,</p>

<p>Till the maiden yields. Rosy is the West,</p>

<p>Rosy is the South,</p>

<p>1034 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>Roses are her cheeks,</p>

<p>And a rose her mouth. When the happy Yes</p>

<p>Falters from her lips, Pass and blush the news</p>

<p>O'er the blowing ships. Over blowing seas,</p>

<p>Over seas at rest, Pass the happy news,</p>

<p>Blush it thro' the West; Till the red man dance</p>

<p>By his red cedar tree, And the red man's babe</p>

<p>Leap, beyond the sea. Blush from West to East,</p>

<p>Blush from East to West, Till the West is East,</p>

<p>Blush it thro' the West. Rosy is the West,</p>

<p>Rosy is the South, Roses are her cheeks,</p>

<p>And a rose her mouth.</p>

<p>XVIII i</p>

<p>I have led her home, my love, my only friend.</p>

<p>There is none like her, none.</p>

<p>And never yet so warmly ran my blood</p>

<p>And sweedy, on and on</p>

<p>Calming itself to the long-wish'd-for end,</p>

<p>Full to the banks, close on the promised good.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>None like her, none.</p>

<p>Just now the dry-tongued laurels' pattering talk</p>

<p>Seem'd her light foot along the garden walk,</p>

<p>And shook my heart to think she comes once more,</p>

<p>But even then I heard her close the door,</p>

<p>The gates of Heaven are closed, and she is gone.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>1035</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>There is none like her, none.</p>

<p>Nor will be when our summers have deceased.</p>

<p>O, art thou sighing for Lebanon</p>

<p>In the long breeze that streams to thy delicious East,</p>

<p>Sighing for Lebanon,</p>

<p>Dark cedar, tho' thy limbs have here increased,</p>

<p>Upon a pastoral slope as fair,</p>

<p>And looking to the South, and fed</p>

<p>With honey'd rain and delicate air,</p>

<p>And haunted by the starry head</p>

<p>Of her whose gentle will has changed my fate,</p>

<p>And made my life a perfumed altar-flame;</p>

<p>And over whom thy darkness must have spread</p>

<p>With such delight as theirs of old, thy great</p>

<p>Forefathers of the thornless garden, there</p>

<p>Shadowing the snow-limb'd Eve from whom she came.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Here will I lie, while these long branches sway, And you fair stars that crown a happy day Go in and out as if at merry play, Who am no more so all forlorn As when it seem'd far better to be born To labour and the mattock-harden'd hand, Than nursed at ease and brought to understand A sad astrology, the boundless plan That makes you tyrants in your iron skies, Innumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes, Cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand His nothingness into man.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>But now shine on, and what care I,</p>

<p>Who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl</p>

<p>The countercharm of space and hollow sky,</p>

<p>And do accept my madness, and would die</p>

<p>To save from some slight shame one simple girl.</p>

<p>1036</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Would die; for sullen-seeming Death may give</p>

<p>More life to love than is or ever was</p>

<p>In our low world, where yet 'tis sweet to live.</p>

<p>Let no one ask me how it came to pass;</p>

<p>It seems that I am happy, that to me</p>

<p>A livelier emerald twinkles in the grass,</p>

<p>A purer sapphire melts into the sea.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Not die; but live a life of truest breath,</p>

<p>And teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs.</p>

<p>O, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs,</p>

<p>Spice his fair banquet with the dust of death?</p>

<p>Make answer, Maud my bliss,</p>

<p>Maud made my Maud by that long loving kiss,</p>

<p>Life of my life, wilt thou not answer this?</p>

<p>"The dusky strand of Death inwoven here</p>

<p>With dear Love's tie, makes Love himself more dear."</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Is that enchanted moan only the swell Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay? And hark the clock within, the silver knell Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white, And died to live, long as my pulses play; But now by this my love has closed her sight And given false death her hand, and stol'n away To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell Among the fragments of the golden day. May nothing there her maiden grace affright! Dear heart, I feel with thee the drowsy spell. My bride to be, my evermore delight, My own heart's heart, my ownest own, farewell; It is but for a little space I go: And ye meanwhile far over moor and fell Beat to the noiseless music of the night! Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow Of your soft splendours that you look so bright?</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IOJ7</p>

<p>XIX 1</p>

<p>Her brother is coming back to-night, Breaking up my dream of delight.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>My dream? do I dream of bliss? I have walk'd awake with Truth.</p>

<p>0 when did a morning shine So rich in atonement as this For my dark-dawning youth, Darken'd watching a mother decline And that dead man at her heart and mine: For who was left to watch her but I ? Yet so did I let my freshness die.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>1 trust that I did not talk To gentle Maud in our walk (For often in lonely wanderings</p>

<p>I have cursed him even to lifeless things)</p>

<p>But I trust that I did not talk,</p>

<p>Not touch on her father's sin:</p>

<p>I am sure I did but speak</p>

<p>Of my mother's faded cheek</p>

<p>When it slowly grew so thin,</p>

<p>That I felt she was slowly dying</p>

<p>Vext with lawyers and harass'd with debt:</p>

<p>For how often I caught her with eyes all wet,</p>

<p>Shaking her head at her son and sighing,</p>

<p>A world of trouble within!</p>

<p>/ have climb'd nearer out of lonely Hell. Beat, happy stars, timing with things below, Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell, Blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe That seems to drawbut it shall not be so: Let all be well, be well.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>And Maud too, Maud was moved</p>

<p>To speak of the mother she loved</p>

<p>As one scarce less forlorn,</p>

<p>Dying abroad and it seems apart</p>

<p>From him who had ceased to share her heart,</p>

<p>And ever mourning over the feud,</p>

<p>The household Fury sprinkled with blood</p>

<p>By which our houses are torn:</p>

<p>How strange was what she said,</p>

<p>When only Maud and the brother</p>

<p>Hung over her dying bed</p>

<p>That Maud's dark father and mine</p>

<p>Had bound us one to the other,</p>

<p>Betrothed us over their wine,</p>

<p>On the day when Maud was born;</p>

<p>Seal'd her mine from her first sweet breath.</p>

<p>Mine, mine by a right, from birth till death</p>

<p>Mine, mineour fathers have sworn.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>But the true blood spilt had in it a heat To dissolve the precious seal on a bond, That, if left uncancell'd, had been so sweet: And none of us thought of a something beyond, A desire that awoke in the heart of the child, As it were a duty done to the tomb, To be friends for her sake, to be reconciled; And I was cursing them and my doom, And letting a dangerous thought run wild While often abroad in the fragrant gloom Of foreign churchesI see her there, Bright English lily, breathing a prayer To be friends, to be reconciled!</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>But then what a flint is he! Abroad, at Florence, at Rome, I find whenever she touch'd on me</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO39</p>

<p>This brother had laugh'd her down, And at last, when each came home, He had darken'd into a frown, Chid her, and forbid her to speak To me, her friend of the years before; And this was what had redden'd her cheek When I bow'd to her on the moor.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Yet Maud, altho' not blind</p>

<p>To the faults of his heart and mind,</p>

<p>I see she cannot but love him,</p>

<p>And says he is rough but kind,</p>

<p>And wishes me to approve him,</p>

<p>And tells me, when she lay</p>

<p>Sick once, with a fear of worse,</p>

<p>That he left his wine and horses and play,</p>

<p>Sat with her, read to her, night and day,</p>

<p>And tended her like a nurse.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Kind? but the deathbed desire Spurn'd by this heir of the liar Rough but kind? yet I know He has plotted against me in this, That he plots against me still. Kind to Maud? that were not amiss. Well, rough but kind; why, let it be so: For shall not Maud have her will?</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>For, Maud, so tender and true, As long as my life endures I feel I shall owe you a debt, That I never can hope to pay; And if ever I should forget That I owe this debt to you And for your sweet sake to yours; O then, what then shall I say?</p>

<p>IO4O ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>If ever I should forget,</p>

<p>May God make me more wretched</p>

<p>Than ever I have been yet!</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>So now I have sworn to bury</p>

<p>All this dead body of hate,</p>

<p>I feel so free and so clear</p>

<p>By the loss of that dead weight,</p>

<p>That I should grow light-headed, I fear,</p>

<p>Fantastically merry;</p>

<p>But that her brother comes, like a blight On my fresh hope, to the Hall to-night.</p>

<p>XX 1</p>

<p>Strange, that I felt so gay, Strange, that / tried to-day To beguile her melancholy; The Sultan, as we name him, She did not wish to blame him But he vext her and perplext her With his worldly talk and folly: Was it gentle to reprove her For stealing out of view From a little lazy lover Who but claims her as his due? Or for chilling his caresses By the coldness of her manners, Nay, the plainness of her dresses? Now I know her but in two, Nor can pronounce upon it If one should ask me whether The habit, hat, and feather, Or the frock and gipsy bonnet Be the neater and completer; For nothing can be sweeter Than maiden Maud in either.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>But to-morrow, if we live, Our ponderous squire will give A grand political dinner To half the squirelings near; And Maud will wear her jewels, And the bird of prey will hover, And the titmouse hope to win her With his chirrup at her ear.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>A grand political dinner</p>

<p>To the men of many acres,</p>

<p>A gathering of the Tory,</p>

<p>A dinner and then a dance</p>

<p>For the maids and marriage-makers,</p>

<p>And every eye but mine will glance</p>

<p>At Maud in all her glory.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>For I am not invited, But, with the Sultan's pardon, I am all as well delighted, For I know her own rose-garden, And mean to linger in it Till the dancing will be over; And then, oh then, come out to me For a minute, but for a minute, Come out to your own true lover, That your true lover may see Your glory also, and render All homage to his own darling, Queen Maud in all her splendour.</p>

<p>XXI</p>

<p>Rivulet crossing my ground, And bringing me down from the Hall This garden-rose that I found, Forgetful of Maud and me,</p>

<p>IO42 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And lost in trouble and moving round Here at the head of a tinkling fall, And trying to pass to the sea;</p>

<p>0 Rivulet, born at the Hall, My Maud has sent it by thee (If I read her sweet will right) On a blushing mission to me, Saying in odour and colour, "Ah, be Among the roses to-night."</p>

<p>XXII 1</p>

<p>Come into the garden, Maud,</p>

<p>For the black bat, night, has flown, Come into the garden, Maud,</p>

<p>1 am here at the gate alone;</p>

<p>And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad, And the musk of the roses blown.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>For a breeze of morning moves, And the planet of Love is on high,</p>

<p>Beginning to faint in the light that she loves On a bed of daffodil sky,</p>

<p>To faint in the light of the sun she loves, To faint in his light, and to die.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>All night have the roses heard</p>

<p>The flute, violin, bassoon; All night has the casement jessamine stirr'd</p>

<p>To the dancers dancing in tune; Till a silence fell with the waking bird,</p>

<p>And a hush with the setting moon.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>I said to the lily, "There is but one</p>

<p>With whom she has heart to be gay. When will the dancers leave her alone?</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO43</p>

<p>She is weary of dance and play." Now half to the setting moon are gone,</p>

<p>And half to the rising day; Low on the sand and loud on the stone</p>

<p>The last wheel echoes away.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>I said to the rose, "The brief night goes</p>

<p>In babble and revel and wine. O young lord-lover, what sighs are those,</p>

<p>For one that will never be thine? But mine, but mine," so I sware to the rose,</p>

<p>"For ever and ever, mine."</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>And the soul of the rose went into my blood,</p>

<p>As the music dash'd in the hall; And long by the garden lake I stood,</p>

<p>For I heard your rivulet fall From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood,</p>

<p>Our wood, that is dearer than all;</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>From the meadow your walks have left so sweet</p>

<p>That whenever a March-wind sighs He sets the jewel-print of your feet</p>

<p>In violets blue as your eyes, To the woody hollows in which we meet</p>

<p>And the valleys of Paradise.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>The slender acacia would not shake</p>

<p>One long milk-bloom on the tree; The white lake-blossom fell into the lake,</p>

<p>As the pimpernel dozed on the lea; But the rose was awake all night for your sake,</p>

<p>Knowing your promise to me; The lilies and roses were all awake,</p>

<p>They sigh'd for the dawn and thee.</p>

<p>1044</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls, Come hither, the dances are done,</p>

<p>In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, Queen lily and rose in one;</p>

<p>Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, To the flowers, and be their sun.</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>There has fallen a splendid tear</p>

<p>From the passion-flower at the gate. She is coming, my dove, my dear;</p>

<p>She is coming, my life, my fate; The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;"</p>

<p>And the white rose weeps, "She is late;" The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;"</p>

<p>And the lily whispers, "I wait."</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>She is coming, my own, my sweet,</p>

<p>Were it ever so airy a tread, My heart would hear her and beat,</p>

<p>Were it earth in an earthy bed; My dust would hear her and beat,</p>

<p>Had I lain for a century dead; Would start and tremble under her feet,</p>

<p>And blossom in purple and red.</p>

<p>Part II I i</p>

<p>"The fault was mine, the fault was mine"</p>

<p>Why am I sitting here so stunn'd and still,</p>

<p>Plucking the harmless wild-flower on the hill ?</p>

<p>It is this guilty hand!</p>

<p>And there rises ever a passionate cry</p>

<p>From underneath in the darkening land</p>

<p>What is it, that has been done ?</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO45</p>

<p>O dawn of Eden bright over earth and sky, The fires of Hell brake out of thy rising sun, The fires of Hell and of Hate; For she, sweet soul, had hardly spoken a word, When her brother ran in his rage to the gate; He came with the babe-faced lord; Heap'd on her terms of disgrace, And while she wept, and I strove to be cool, He fiercely gave me the lie, Till I with as fierce an anger spoke, And he struck me, madman, over the face, Struck me before the languid fool, Who was gaping and grinning by: Struck for himself an evil stroke; Wrought for his house an irredeemable woe For front to front in an hour we stood, And a million horrible bellowing echoes broke From the red-ribb'd hollow behind the wood, And thunder'd up into Heaven the Christless code, That must have life for a blow. Ever and ever afresh they seem'd to grow. Was it he lay there with a fading eye? "The fault was mine," he whisper'd, "fly!" Then glided out of the joyous wood The ghastly Wraith of one that I know; And there rang on a sudden a passionate cry, A cry for a brother's blood: It will ring in my heart and my ears, till I die, till I die.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Is it gone? my pulses beat What was it? a lying trick of the brain? Yet I thought I saw her stand, A shadow there at my feet, High over the shadowy land. It is gone; and the heavens fall in a gentle rain, When they should burst and drown with deluging storms</p>

<p>The feeble vassals of wine and anger and lust,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>See what a lovely shell, Small and pure as a pearl, Lying close to my foot, Frail, but a work divine, Made so fairily well With delicate spire and whorl, How exquisitely minute, A miracle of design!</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>What is it? a learned man Could give it a clumsy name. Let him name it who can, The beauty would be the same.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>The tiny cell is forlorn, Void of the little living will That made it stir on the shore. Did he stand at the diamond door Of his house in a rainbow frill? Did he push, when he was uncurl'd, A golden foot or a fairy horn Thro' his dim water-world?</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Slight, to be crush'd with a tap Of my finger-nail on the sand, Small, but a work divine, Frail, but of force to withstand, Year upon year, the shock</p>

<p>The little hearts that know not how to forgive: Arise, my God, and strike, for we hold Thee just, Strike dead the whole weak race of venomous worms, That sting each other here in the dust; We are not worthy to live.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>IO47</p>

<p>Of cataract seas that snap The three-decker's oaken spine Athwart the ledges of rock, Here on the Breton strand!</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Breton, not Briton; here Like a shipwreck'd man on a coast Of ancient fable and fear Plagued with a flitting to and fro, A disease, a hard mechanic ghost That never came from on high Nor ever arose from below, But only moves with the moving eye, Flying along the land and the main Why should it look like Maud? Am I to be overawed By what I cannot but know Is a juggle born of the brain?</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Back from the Breton coast, Sick of a nameless fear, Back to the dark sea-line Looking, thinking of all I have lost; An old song vexes my ear; But that of Lamech is mine.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>For years, a measureless ill, For years, for ever, to part But she, she would love me still; And as long, O God, as she Have a grain of love for me, So long, no doubt, no doubt, Shall I nurse in my dark heart, However weary, a spark of will Not to be trampled out.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Strange, that the mind, when fraught</p>

<p>With a passion so intense</p>

<p>One would think that it well</p>

<p>Might drown all life in the eye,</p>

<p>That it should, by being so over-wrought,</p>

<p>Suddenly strike on a sharper sense</p>

<p>For a shell, or a flower, little things</p>

<p>Which else would have been past by I</p>

<p>And now I remember, I,</p>

<p>When he lay dying there,</p>

<p>I noticed one of his many rings</p>

<p>(For he had many, poor worm) and thought</p>

<p>It is his mother's hair.</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Who knows if he be dead?</p>

<p>Whether I need have fled?</p>

<p>Am I guilty of blood ?</p>

<p>However this may be,</p>

<p>Comfort her, comfort her, all things good,</p>

<p>While I am over the sea!</p>

<p>Let me and my passionate love go by,</p>

<p>But speak to her all things holy and high,</p>

<p>Whatever happens to me!</p>

<p>Me and my harmful love go by;</p>

<p>But come to her waking, find her asleep,</p>

<p>Powers of the height, Powers of the deep,</p>

<p>And comfort her tho' I die.</p>

<p>Ill</p>

<p>Courage, poor heart of stone! I will not ask thee why Thou canst not understand That thou art left for ever alone: Courage, poor stupid heart of stone. Or if I ask thee why,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO49</p>

<p>She is but dead, and the time is at hand When thou shalt more than die.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>O that 'twere possible</p>

<p>After long grief and pain</p>

<p>To find the arms of my true love</p>

<p>Round me once again!</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>When I was wont to meet her</p>

<p>In the silent woody places By the home that gave me birth, We stood tranced in long embraces Mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter Than anything on earth.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>A shadow flits before me,</p>

<p>Not thou, but like to thee;</p>

<p>Ah Christ, that it were possible</p>

<p>For one short hour to see</p>

<p>The souls we loved, that they might tell us</p>

<p>What and where they be.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>It leads me forth at evening,</p>

<p>It lightly winds and steals</p>

<p>In a cold white robe before me,</p>

<p>When all my spirit reels</p>

<p>At the shouts, the leagues of lights,</p>

<p>And the roaring of the wheels.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Half the night I waste in sighs, Half in dreams I sorrow after The delight of early skies; In a wakeful doze I sorrow</p>

<p>1050 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>For the hand, the lips, the eyes, For the meeting of the morrow The delight of happy laughter, The delight of low replies.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>'Tis a morning pure and sweet And a dewy splendour falls On the little flower that clings To the turrets and the walls; 'Tis a morning pure and sweet, And the light and shadow fleet; She is walking in the meadow, And the woodland echo rings; In a moment we shall meet; She is singing in the meadow, And the rivulet at her feet Ripples on in light and shadow To the ballad that she sings.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Do I hear her sing as of old,</p>

<p>My bird with the shining head,</p>

<p>My own dove with the tender eye ?</p>

<p>But there rings on a sudden a passionate cry,</p>

<p>There is some one dying or dead,</p>

<p>And a sullen thunder is roll'd;</p>

<p>For a tumult shakes the city,</p>

<p>And I wake, my dream is fled;</p>

<p>In the shuddering dawn, behold,</p>

<p>Without knowledge, without pity,</p>

<p>By the curtains of my bed</p>

<p>That abiding phantom cold.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Get thee hence, nor come again, Mix not memory with doubt, Pass, thou deathlike type of pain, Pass and cease to move about, 'Tis the blot upon the brain That will show itself without.</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Then I rise, the eavedrops fall, And the yellow vapours choke The great city sounding wide; The day comes, a dull red ball Wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke On the misty river-tide.</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>Thro' the hubbub of the market</p>

<p>I steal, a wasted frame,</p>

<p>It crosses here, it crosses there,</p>

<p>Thro' all that crowd confused and loud</p>

<p>The shadow still the same;</p>

<p>And on my heavy eyelids</p>

<p>My anguish hangs like shame.</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>Alas for her that met me,</p>

<p>That heard me softly call,</p>

<p>Came glimmering thro' the laurels</p>

<p>At the quiet evenfall,</p>

<p>In the garden by the turrets</p>

<p>Of the old manorial hall.</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>Would the happy spirit descend, From the realms of light and song, In the chamber or the street, As she looks among the blest, Should I fear to greet my friend Or to say "Forgive the wrong," Or to ask her, "Take me, sweet, To the regions of thy rest"?</p>

<p>13</p>

<p>But the broad light glares and beats, And the shadow flits and fleets And will not let me be;</p>

<p>1052 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And I loathe the squares and streets, And the faces that one meets, Hearts with no love for me: Always I long to creep Into some still cavern deep, There to weep, and weep, and weep My whole soul out to thee.</p>

<p>V 1</p>

<p>Dead, long dead, Long dead!</p>

<p>And my heart is a handful of dust,</p>

<p>And the wheels go over my head,</p>

<p>And my bones are shaken with pain,</p>

<p>For into a shallow grave they are thrust,</p>

<p>Only a yard beneath the street,</p>

<p>And the hoofs of the horses beat, beat,</p>

<p>The hoofs of the horses beat,</p>

<p>Beat into my scalp and my brain,</p>

<p>With never an end to the stream of passing feet,</p>

<p>Driving, hurrying, marrying, burying,</p>

<p>Clamor and rumble, and ringing and clatter,</p>

<p>And here beneath it is all as bad</p>

<p>For I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;</p>

<p>To have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?</p>

<p>But up and down and to and fro,</p>

<p>Ever about me the dead men go;</p>

<p>And then to hear a dead man chatter</p>

<p>Is enough to drive one mad.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Wretchedest age, since Time began, They cannot even bury a man;</p>

<p>And tho' we paid our tithes in the days that are gone,</p>

<p>Not a bell was rung, not a prayer was read;</p>

<p>It is that which makes us loud in the world of the dead;</p>

<p>There is none that does his work, not one;</p>

<p>A touch of their office might have sufficed,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON IO53</p>

<p>But the churchmen fain would kill their church, As the churches have kill'd their Christ.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>See, there is one of us sobbing,</p>

<p>No limit to his distress;</p>

<p>And another, a lord of all things, praying</p>

<p>To his own great self, as I guess;</p>

<p>And another, a statesman there, betraying</p>

<p>His party-secret, fool, to the press;</p>

<p>And yonder a vile physician, blabbing</p>

<p>The case of his patientall for what?</p>

<p>To tickle the maggot born in an empty head,</p>

<p>And wheedle a world that loves him not,</p>

<p>For it is but a world of the dead.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Nothing but idiot gabble!</p>

<p>For the prophecy given of old</p>

<p>And then not understood,</p>

<p>Has come to pass as foretold;</p>

<p>Not let any man think for the public good,</p>

<p>But babble, merely for babble.</p>

<p>For I never whisper'd a private affair</p>

<p>Within the hearing of cat or mouse,</p>

<p>No, not to myself in the closet alone,</p>

<p>But I heard it shouted at once from the top of the house;</p>

<p>Everything came to be known:</p>

<p>Who told him we were there?</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Not that gray old wolf, for he came not back From the wilderness, full of wolves, where he used to lie; He has gather'd the bones for his o'ergrown whelp to crack;</p>

<p>Crack them now for yourself, and howl, and die. 6</p>

<p>Prophet, curse me the blabbing lip,</p>

<p>And curse me the British vermin, the rat;</p>

<p>1054 ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>I know not whether he came in the Hanover ship,</p>

<p>But I knows that he lies and listens mute</p>

<p>In an ancient mansion's crannies and holes:</p>

<p>Arsenic, arsenic, sure, would do it,</p>

<p>Except that now we poison our babes, poor souls!</p>

<p>It is all used up for that.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Tell him now; she is standing here at my head;</p>

<p>Not beautiful now, not even kind;</p>

<p>He may take her now; for she never speaks her mind,</p>

<p>But is ever the one thing silent here.</p>

<p>She is not of us, as I divine;</p>

<p>She comes from another stiller world of the dead, Stiller, not fairer than mine.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>But I know where a garden grows,</p>

<p>Fairer than aught in the world beside,</p>

<p>All made up of the lily and rose</p>

<p>That blow by night, when the season is good,</p>

<p>To the sound of dancing music and flutes:</p>

<p>It is only flowers, they had no fruits,</p>

<p>And I almost fear they are not roses, but blood;</p>

<p>For the keeper was one, so full of pride,</p>

<p>He linkt a dead man there to a spectral bride;</p>

<p>For he, if he had not been a Sultan of brutes,</p>

<p>Would he have had that hole in his side?</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>But what will the old man say?</p>

<p>He laid a cruel snare in a pit</p>

<p>To catch a friend of mine one stormy day;</p>

<p>Yet now I could even weep to think of it;</p>

<p>For what will the old man say</p>

<p>When he comes to the second corpse in the pit?</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>Friend, to be struck by the public foe, Then to strike him and lay him low,</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>IO55</p>

<p>That were a public merit, far, Whatever the Quaker holds, from sin; But the red life spilt for a private blow I swear to you, lawful and lawless war Are scarcely even akin.</p>

<p>ii</p>

<p>0 me, why have they not buried me deep enough? Is it kind to have made me a grave so rough,</p>

<p>Me, that was never a quiet sleeper? Maybe still I am but half-dead; Then I cannot be wholly dumb:</p>

<p>1 will cry to the steps above my head,</p>

<p>And somebody, surely, some kind heart will come To bury me, bury me Deeper, ever so litde deeper.</p>

<p>Part III VI i</p>

<p>My life has crept so long on a broken wing</p>

<p>Thro' cells of madness, haunts of horror and fear,</p>

<p>That I come to be grateful at last for a little thing:</p>

<p>My mood is changed, for it fell at a time of year</p>

<p>When the face of night is fair on the dewy downs,</p>

<p>And the shining daffodil dies, and the Charioteer</p>

<p>And starry Gemini hang like glorious crowns</p>

<p>Over Orion's grave low down in the west,</p>

<p>That like a silent lightning under the stars</p>

<p>She seem'd to divide in a dream from a band of the blest,</p>

<p>And spoke of a hope for the world in the coming wars</p>

<p>"And in that hope, dear soul, let trouble have rest,</p>

<p>Knowing I tarry for thee," and pointed to Mars,</p>

<p>As he glow'd like a ruddy shield on the Lion's breast.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>And it was but a dream, yet it yielded a dear delight To have look'd, tho' but in a dream, upon eyes so fair, That had been in a weary world my one thing bright;</p>

<p>ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON</p>

<p>And it was but a dream, yet it lighten'd my despair</p>

<p>When I thought that a war would arise in defence of the right,</p>

<p>That an iron tyranny now should bend or cease,</p>

<p>The glory of manhood stand on his ancient height,</p>

<p>Nor Britain's one sole God be the millionaire:</p>

<p>No more shall commerce be all in all, and Peace</p>

<p>Pipe on her pastoral hillock a languid note,</p>

<p>And watch her harvest ripen, her herd increase,</p>

<p>Nor the cannon-bullet rust on a slothful shore,</p>

<p>And the cobweb woven across the cannon's throat</p>

<p>Shall shake its threaded tears in the wind no more.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>And as months ran on and rumour of battle grew,</p>

<p>"It is time, it is time, O passionate heart," said I</p>

<p>(For I cleaved to a cause that I felt to be pure and true),</p>

<p>"It is time, O passionate heart and morbid eye,</p>

<p>That old hysterical mock-disease should die."</p>

<p>And I stood on a giant deck and mix'd my breath</p>

<p>With a loyal people shouting a battle-cry,</p>

<p>Till I saw the dreary phantom arise and fly</p>

<p>Far into the North, and battle, and seas of death.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Let it go or stay, so I wake to the higher aims</p>

<p>Of a land that has lost for a little her lust of gold,</p>

<p>And love of a peace that was full of wrongs and shames,</p>

<p>Horrible, hateful, monstrous, not to be told;</p>

<p>And hail once more to the banner of battle unroll'd!</p>

<p>Tho' many a light shall darken, and many shall weep</p>

<p>For those that are crush'd in the clash of jarring claims,</p>

<p>Yet God's just wrath shall be wreak'd on a giant liar;</p>

<p>And many a darkness into the light shall leap,</p>

<p>And shine in the sudden making of splendid names,</p>

<p>And noble thought be freer under the sun,</p>

<p>And the heart of a people beat with one desire;</p>

<p>For the peace, that I deem'd no peace, is over and done,</p>

<p>And now by the side of the Black and the Baltic deep,</p>

<p>And deathful-grinning mouths of the fortress, flames</p>

<p>The blood-red blossom of war with a heart of fire.</p>

<p>RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Let it flame or fade, and the war roll down like a wind, We have proved we have hearts in a cause, we are noble still And myself have awaked, as it seems, to the better mind It is better to fight for the good, than to rail at the ill; I have felt with my native land, I am one with my kind, I embrace the purpose of God, and the doom assign'd.</p>

<p>Crossing the Bar</p>

<p>Sunset and evening star,</p>

<p>And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar,</p>

<p>When I put out to sea,</p>

<p>But such a tide as moving seems asleep,</p>

<p>Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep</p>

<p>Turns again home.</p>

<p>Twilight and evening bell,</p>

<p>And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell,</p>

<p>When I embark;</p>

<p>For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place</p>

<p>The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face</p>

<p>When I have crossed the bar.</p>

<p>RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES, LORD HOUGHTON [i809-1885]</p>

<p>Sonnet</p>

<p>Because the Few with signal virtue crowned, The heights and pinnacles of human mind,</p>

<p>Sadder and wearier than the rest are found, Wish not thy Soul less wise or less refined.</p>

<p>True that the small delights which every day Cheer and distract the pilgrim are not theirs;</p>

<p>WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY</p>

<p>True that, though free from passion's lawless sway,</p>

<p>A loftier being brings severer cares. Yet have they special pleasures, even mirth, By those undreamt of who have only trod Life's valley smooth; and if the rolling earth</p>

<p>To their nice ear have many a painful tone, They know, Man does not live by Joy alone But by the presence of the power of God.</p>

<p>WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY [1811-1863}</p>

<p>The End of the Play</p>

<p>The play is done; the curtain drops,</p>

<p>Slow falling to the prompter's bell: A moment yet the actor stops,</p>

<p>And looks around, to say farewell. It is an irksome word and task;</p>

<p>And, when he's laughed and said his say, He shows, as he removes the mask,</p>

<p>A face that's anything but gay.</p>

<p>One word, ere yet the evening ends,</p>

<p>Let's close it with a parting rhyme, And pledge a hand to all young friends,</p>

<p>As fits the merry Christmas-time. On life's wide scene you, too, have parts,</p>

<p>That Fate ere long shall bid you play; Good night! with honest gentle hearts</p>

<p>A kindly greeting go alway!</p>

<p>Good night!I'd say, the griefs, the joys,</p>

<p>Just hinted in this mimic page, The triumphs and defeats of boys,</p>

<p>Are but repeated in our age. I'd say, your woes were not less keen,</p>

<p>Your hopes more vain than those of men; Your pangs or pleasures of fifteen</p>

<p>At forty-five played o'er again.</p>

<p>WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY IO59</p>

<p>I'd say, we suffer and we strive,</p>

<p>Not less or more as men than boys; With grizzled beards at forty-five,</p>

<p>As erst at twelve in corduroys. And if, in time of sacred youth,</p>

<p>We learned at home to love and pray, Pray Heaven that early Love and Truth</p>

<p>May never wholly pass away.</p>

<p>And in the world, as in the school,</p>

<p>I'd say, how fate may change and shift; The prize be sometimes with the fool,</p>

<p>The race not always to the swift. The strong may yield, the good may fall,</p>

<p>The great man be a vulgar clown, The knave be lifted over all,</p>

<p>The kind cast pitilessly down.</p>

<p>Who knows the inscrutable design?</p>

<p>Blessed be He who took and gave! Why should your mother, Charles, not mine,</p>

<p>Be weeping at her darling's grave? We bow to Heaven that will'd it so,</p>

<p>That darkly rules the fate of all. That sends the respite or the blow,</p>

<p>That's free to give, or to recall.</p>

<p>This crowns his feast with wine and wit:</p>

<p>Who brought him to that mirth and state? His betters, see, below him sit,</p>

<p>Or hunger hopeless at the gate. Who bade the mud from Dives' wheel</p>

<p>To spurn the rags of Lazarus? Come, brother, in that dust we'll kneel,</p>

<p>Confessing Heaven that ruled it thus.</p>

<p>So each shall mourn, in life's advance, Dear hopes, dear friends, untimely killed;</p>

<p>Shall grieve for many a forfeit chance, And longing passion unfulfilled.</p>

<p>CHARLES KINGSLEY</p>

<p>Amen! whatever fate be sent,</p>

<p>Pray God the heart may kindly glow, Although the head with cares be bent,</p>

<p>And whitened with the winter snow.</p>

<p>Come wealth or want, come good or ill,</p>

<p>Let young and old accept their part, And bow before the Awful Will,</p>

<p>And bear it with an honest heart, Who misses or who wins the prize.</p>

<p>Go, lose or conquer as you can; But if you fail, or if you rise,</p>

<p>Be each, pray God, a gendeman.</p>

<p>A gentleman, or old or young!</p>

<p>(Bear kindly with my humble lays); The sacred chorus first was sung</p>

<p>Upon the first of Christmas Days: The shepherds heard it overhead</p>

<p>The joyful angels raised it then: Glory to Heaven on high, it said,</p>

<p>And peace on earth to gentle men.</p>

<p>My song, save this, is little worth;</p>

<p>I lay the weary pen aside, And wish you health, and love, and mirth,</p>

<p>As fits the solemn Christmas-tide. As fits the holy Christmas birth,</p>

<p>Be this, good friends, our carol still Be peace on earth, be peace on earth,</p>

<p>To men of gentle will.</p>

<p>The Sands of Dee</p>

<p>'O Mary, go and call the cattle home,</p>

<p>And call the cattle home,</p>

<p>And call the cattle home</p>

<p>Across the sands of Dee;' The western wind was wild and dank with foam,</p>

<p>And all alone went she.</p>

<p>The western tide crept up along the sand,</p>

<p>And o'er and o'er the sand,</p>

<p>And round and round the sand,</p>

<p>As far as eye could see. The rolling mist came down and hid the land:</p>

<p>And never home came she.</p>

<p>'Oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair,</p>

<p>A tress of golden hair,</p>

<p>A drowned maiden's hair</p>

<p>Above the nets at sea? Was never salmon yet that shone so fair</p>

<p>Among the stakes of Dee.'</p>

<p>They rowed her in across the rolling foam,</p>

<p>The cruel crawling foam,</p>

<p>The cruel hungry foam,</p>

<p>To her grave beside the sea: But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home</p>

<p>Across the sands of Dee.</p>

<p>Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;</p>

<p>O the happy hours we lay Deep in fern on Airly Beacon,</p>

<p>Courting through the summer's dayl</p>

<p>Young and Old</p>

<p>When all the world is young, lad,</p>

<p>And all the trees are green; And every goose a swan, lad,</p>

<p>And every lass a queen; Then hey for boot and horse, lad,</p>

<p>And round the world away; Young blood must have its course, lad,</p>

<p>And every dog his day.</p>

<p>When all the world is old, lad,</p>

<p>And all the trees are brown; And all the sport is stale, lad,</p>

<p>And all the wheels run down: Creep home, and take your place there,</p>

<p>The spent and maimed among: God grant you find one face there</p>

<p>You loved when all was young.</p>

<p>Ode to the North-east Wind</p>

<p>Welcome, wild North-easter!</p>

<p>Shame it is to see Odes to every zephyr;</p>

<p>Ne'er a verse to thee. Welcome, black North-easter!</p>

<p>O'er the German foam; O'er the Danish moorlands,</p>

<p>From thy frozen home. Tired we are of summer,</p>

<p>Tired of gaudy glare, Showers soft and steaming,</p>

<p>Hot and breathless air. Tired of listless dreaming,</p>

<p>Through the lazy day: Jovial wind of winter</p>

<p>Turn us out to play! Sweep the golden reed-beds;</p>

<p>Crisp the lazy dyke;</p>

<p>CHARLES KINGSLEY</p>

<p>Hunger into madness</p>

<p>Every plunging pike. Fill the lake with wild-fowl;</p>

<p>Fill the marsh with snipe; While on dreary moorlands</p>

<p>Lonely curlew pipe. Through the black fir-forest</p>

<p>Thunder harsh and dry, Shattering down the snow-flakes</p>

<p>Off the curdled sky. Hark! The brave North-easter!</p>

<p>Breast-high lies the scent, On by holt and headland,</p>

<p>Over heath and bent. Chime, ye dappled darlings,</p>

<p>Through the sleet and snow. Who can over-ride you?</p>

<p>Let the horses go! Chime, ye dappled darlings,</p>

<p>Down the roaring blast You shall see a fox die</p>

<p>Ere an hour be past. Go! and rest to-morrow,</p>

<p>Hunting in your dreams, While our skates are ringing</p>

<p>O'er the frozen streams. Let the luscious South-wind</p>

<p>Breathe in lovers' sighs, While the lazy gallants</p>

<p>Bask in ladies' eyes. What does he but soften</p>

<p>Heart alike and pen? 'Tis the hard grey weather</p>

<p>Breeds hard English men. What's the soft South-wester?</p>

<p>'Tis the ladies' breeze, Bringing home their true-loves</p>

<p>Out of all the seas: But the black North-easter,</p>

<p>Through the snowstorm hurled,</p>

<p>J. WILSON (?)</p>

<p>Drives our English hearts of oak</p>

<p>Seaward round the world. Come, as came our fathers,</p>

<p>Heralded by thee, Conquering from the eastward,</p>

<p>Lords by land and sea. Come; and strong within us</p>

<p>Stir the Vikings' blood; Bracing brain and sinew;</p>

<p>Blow, thou wind of God!</p>

<p>Listen to me, as when ye heard our father Sing long ago the song of other shores Listen to me, and then in chorus gather All your deep voices as ye pull your oars:</p>

<p>Fair these broad meadsthese hoary woods are grand; But we are exiles from our fathers' land.</p>

<p>From the lone shieling of the misty island Mountains divide us, and the waste of seas</p>

<p>Yet still the blood is strong, the heart is Highland, And we in dreams behold the Hebrides: Fair these broad meads, &c.</p>

<p>We ne'er shall tread the fancy-haunted valley,</p>

<p>Where 'tween the dark hills creeps the small clear stream, In arms around the patriarch banner rally,</p>

<p>Nor see the moon on royal tombstones gleam: Fair these broad meads, &c.</p>

<p>When the bold kindred, in the time long-vanished, Conquered the soil and fortified the keep,</p>

<p>No seer foretold the children would be banished, That a degenerate Lord might boast his sheep: Fair these broad meads, &c.</p>

<p>Prospice</p>

<p>Fear death ?to feel the fog in my throat,</p>

<p>The mist in my face, When the snows begin, and the blasts denote</p>

<p>I am nearing the place, The power of the night, the press of the storm,</p>

<p>The post of the foe; Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,</p>

<p>Yet the strong man must go: For the journey is done and the summit attained,</p>

<p>And the barriers fall, Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,</p>

<p>The reward of it all. I was ever a fighter, soone fight more,</p>

<p>The best and the last! I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore,</p>

<p>And bade me creep past. No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers</p>

<p>The heroes of old, Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears</p>

<p>Of pain, darkness and cold. For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,</p>

<p>The black minute's at end, And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,</p>

<p>Shall dwindle, shall blend, Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,</p>

<p>Then a light, then thy breast, O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again,</p>

<p>And with God be the rest!</p>

<p>Come foreign ragelet Discord burst in slaughter!</p>

<p>O then for clansmen true, and stern claymore The hearts that would have given their blood like water, Beat heavily beyond the Atlantic roar:</p>

<p>Fair these broad meadsthese hoary woods are grand; But we are exiles from our fathers' land.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>659 'How They Brought the Good News from</p>

<p>Ghent to Aix' [16]</p>

<p>I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he; I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three; 'Good speed!' cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew; 'Speed!' echoed the wall to us galloping through; Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest, And into the midnight we galloped abreast.</p>

<p>Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place; I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight, Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right, Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit, Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.</p>

<p>'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near</p>

<p>Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;</p>

<p>At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;</p>

<p>At Diiffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be;</p>

<p>And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,</p>

<p>So Joris broke silence with 'Yet there is time!'</p>

<p>At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun, And against him the cattle stood black every one, To stare through the mist at us galloping past, And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last, With resolute shoulders, each butting away The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.</p>

<p>And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track; And one eye's black intelligence,ever that glance O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance! And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.</p>

<p>By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, 'Stay spur! Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her, We'll remember at Aix'for one heard the quick wheeze</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING I067</p>

<p>Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,</p>

<p>And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,</p>

<p>As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.</p>

<p>So we were left galloping, Joris and I,</p>

<p>Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;</p>

<p>The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,</p>

<p>"Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;</p>

<p>Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,</p>

<p>And 'Gallop,' gasped Joris, 'for Aix is in sight!'</p>

<p>'How they'll greet us!'and all in a moment his roan Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone; And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate, With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim, And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.</p>

<p>Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall, Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all, Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear, Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer; Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good, Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.</p>

<p>And all I remember is, friends flocking round</p>

<p>As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;</p>

<p>And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,</p>

<p>As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,</p>

<p>Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)</p>

<p>Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.</p>

<p>The Lost Leader</p>

<p>Just for a handful of silver he left us,</p>

<p>Just for a riband to stick in his coat Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us,</p>

<p>Lost all the others she lets us devote; They, with the gold to give, doled him out silver,</p>

<p>So much was theirs who so little allowed:</p>

<p>io68</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>How all our copper had gone for his service!</p>

<p>Ragswere they purple, his heart had been proud! We that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him,</p>

<p>Lived in his mild and magnificent eye, Learned his great language, caught his clear accents,</p>

<p>Made him our pattern to live and to die! Shakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,</p>

<p>Burns, Shelley, Were with us,they watch from their graves! He alone breaks from the van and the freemen,</p>

<p>He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves 1</p>

<p>We shall march prospering,not through his presence;</p>

<p>Songs may inspirit us,not from his lyre; Deeds will be done,while he boasts his quiescence,</p>

<p>Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire: Blot out his name, then, record one lost soul more,</p>

<p>One task more declined, one more footpath untrod, One more triumph for devils and sorrow for angels,</p>

<p>One wrong more to man, one more insult to God! Life's night begins: let him never come back to us!</p>

<p>There would be doubt, hesitation and pain, Forced praise on our partthe glimmer of twilight,</p>

<p>Never glad confident morning again! Best fight on well, for we taught him,strike gallantly,</p>

<p>Menace our heart ere we master his own; Then let him receive the new knowledge and wait us,</p>

<p>Pardoned in Heaven, the first by the throne 1</p>

<p>66/ Home-thoughts, from Abroad</p>

<p>O, to be in England</p>

<p>Now that April's there,</p>

<p>And whoever wakes in England</p>

<p>Sees, some morning, unaware,</p>

<p>That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf</p>

<p>Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,</p>

<p>While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough</p>

<p>In Englandnow!</p>

<p>And after April, when May follows,</p>

<p>And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO69</p>

<p>Hark, where my blossom'd pear-tree in the hedge Leans to the field and scatters on the clover Blossoms and dewdropsat the bent spray's edge That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over, Lest you should think he never could recapture The first fine careless rapture! And though the fields look rough with hoary dew, All will be gay when noontide wakes anew The buttercups, the little children's dower Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!</p>

<p>Home-thoughts, from the Sea</p>

<p>Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-west died away; Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay; Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay; In the dimmest North-east distance dawn'd Gibraltar grand and gray;</p>

<p>'Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?' say,</p>

<p>Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God to praise and pray, While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.</p>

<p>Parting at Morning</p>

<p>Round the cape of a sudden came the sea, And the sun look'd over the mountain's rim: And straight was a path of gold for him, And the need of a world of men for me.</p>

<p>The Lost Mistress</p>

<p>All's over, then: does truth sound bitter</p>

<p>As one at first believes? Hark, 'tis the sparrows' good-night twitter</p>

<p>About your cottage eaves!</p>

<p>And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,</p>

<p>I noticed that, to-day; One day more bursts them open fully</p>

<p>You know the red turns gray.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>To-morrow we meet the same then, dearest?</p>

<p>May I take your hand in mine? Mere friends are we,well, friends the merest</p>

<p>Keep much that I resign:</p>

<p>For each glance of the eye so bright and black, Though I keep with heart's endeavour,</p>

<p>Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back, Though it stay in my soul for ever!</p>

<p>Yet I will but say what mere friends say,</p>

<p>Or only a thought stronger; I will hold your hand but as long as all may,</p>

<p>Or so very litde longer!</p>

<p>665 The Last Ride Together</p>

<p>I saidThen, dearest, since 'tis so, Since now at length my fate I know, Since nothing all my love avails, Since all, my life seem'd meant for, fails,</p>

<p>Since this was written and needs must be My whole heart rises up to bless Your name in pride and thankfulness! Take back the hope you gave,I claim Only a memory of the same, And this beside, if you will not blame;</p>

<p>Your leave for one more last ride with me.</p>

<p>My mistress bent that brow of hers, Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs When pity would be softening through, Fix'd me a breathing-while or two</p>

<p>With life or death in the balance: right! The blood replenish'd me again; My last thought was at least not vain: I and my mistress, side by side Shall be together, breathe and ride, So, one day more am I deified.</p>

<p>Who knows but the world may end to-night?</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO7I</p>

<p>Hush! if you saw some western cloud</p>

<p>All billowy-bosom'd, over-bow'd</p>

<p>By many benedictionssun's</p>

<p>And moon's and evening-star's at once</p>

<p>And so, you, looking and loving best, Conscious grew, your passion drew Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too, Down on you, near and yet more near, Till flesh must fade for heaven was here! Thus leant she and linger'djoy and fear!</p>

<p>Thus lay she a moment on my breast.</p>

<p>Then we began to ride. My soul Smooth'd itself out, a long-cramp'd scroll Freshening and fluttering in the wind. Past hopes already lay behind.</p>

<p>What need to strive with a life awry? Had I said that, had I done this, So might I gain, so might I miss. Might she have loved me? just as well She might have hated, who can tell! Where had I been now if the worst befell?</p>

<p>And here we are riding, she and I.</p>

<p>Fail I alone, in words and deeds? Why, all men strive and who succeeds? We rode; it seem'd my spirit flew, Saw other regions, cities new,</p>

<p>As the world rush'd by on either side. I thought,All labour, yet no less Bear up beneath their unsuccess. Look at the end of work, contrast The petty done, the undone vast, This present of theirs with the hopeful past!</p>

<p>I hoped she would love me; here we ride.</p>

<p>What hand and brain went ever pair'd? What heart alike conceived and dared? What act proved all its thought had been? What will but felt the fleshly screen?</p>

<p>1072 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>We ride and I see her bosom heave. There's many a crown for who can reach. Ten lines, a statesman's life in each! The flag stuck on a heap of bones, A soldier's doing! what atones? They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.</p>

<p>My riding is better, by their leave.</p>

<p>What does it all mean, poet? Well, Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell What we felt only; you express'd You hold things beautiful the best,</p>

<p>And pace them in rhyme so, side by side. 'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then, Have you yourself what's best for men? Are youpoor, sick, old ere your time Nearer one whit your own sublime Than we who never have turn'd a rhyme?</p>

<p>Sing, riding's a joy! For me, I ride.</p>

<p>And you, great sculptorso, you gave A score of years to Art, her slave, And that's your Venus, whence we turn To yonder girl that fords the burn!</p>

<p>You acquiesce, and shall I repine? What, man of music, you grown gray With notes and nothing else to say, Is this your sole praise from a friend, 'Greatly his opera's strains intend, Put in music we know how fashions end!'</p>

<p>I gave my youth: but we ride, in fine.</p>

<p>Who knows what's fit for us? Had fate Proposed bliss here should sublimate My beinghad I sign'd the bond Still one must lead some life beyond,</p>

<p>Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried. This foot once planted on the goal, This glory-garland round my soul, Could I descry such? Try and test!</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO73</p>

<p>I sink back shuddering from the quest Earth being so good, would heaven seem best? Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.</p>

<p>And yetshe has not spoke so long! What if heaven be that, fair and strong At life's best, with our eyes upturn'd Whither life's flower is first discern'd,</p>

<p>We, fix'd so, ever should so abide? What if we still ride on, we two With life for ever old yet new, Changed not in kind but in degree, The instant made eternity, And heaven just prove that I and she</p>

<p>Ride, ride together, for ever ride?</p>

<p>666 Pippa's Song</p>

<p>The year's at the spring, And day's at the morn; Morning's at seven; The hill-side's dew-pearl'd; The lark's on the wing; The snail's on the thorn; God's in His heaven All's right with the world!</p>

<p>667 You'll Love Me Yet</p>

<p>You'll love me yet!and I can tarry</p>

<p>Your love's protracted growing: June rear'd that bunch of flowers you carry,</p>

<p>From seeds of April's sowing.</p>

<p>I plant a heartful now: some seed</p>

<p>At least is sure to strike, And yieldwhat you'll not pluck indeed,</p>

<p>Not love, but, may be, like.</p>

<p>You'll look at least on love's remains,</p>

<p>A grave's one violet: Your look?that pays a thousand pains.</p>

<p>What's death? You'll love me yet!</p>

<p>Ferrara</p>

<p>That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,</p>

<p>Looking as if she were alive. I call</p>

<p>That piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf's hands</p>

<p>Worked busily a day, and there she stands.</p>

<p>Will't please you sit and look at her? I said</p>

<p>"Fra Pandolf" by design, for never read</p>

<p>Strangers like you that pictured countenance,</p>

<p>The depth and passion of its earnest glance,</p>

<p>But to myself they turned (since none puts by</p>

<p>The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)</p>

<p>And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,</p>

<p>How such a glance came there; so, not the first</p>

<p>Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not</p>

<p>Her husband's presence only, called that spot</p>

<p>Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps</p>

<p>Fra Pandolf chanced to say, "Her mantle laps</p>

<p>Over my lady's wrist too much," or "Paint</p>

<p>Must never hope to reproduce the faint</p>

<p>Half-flush that dies along her throat:" such stuff</p>

<p>Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough</p>

<p>For calling up that spot of joy. She had</p>

<p>A hearthow shall I say?too soon made glad.</p>

<p>Too easily impressed: she liked whate'er</p>

<p>She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.</p>

<p>Sir, 'twas all one! My favor at her breast,</p>

<p>The dropping of the daylight in the West,</p>

<p>The bough of cherries some officious fool</p>

<p>Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule</p>

<p>She rode with round the terraceall and each</p>

<p>Would draw from her alike the approving speech,</p>

<p>Or blush, at least. She thanked men,good! but thanked</p>

<p>SomehowI know not howas if she ranked</p>

<p>My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</p>

<p>With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame</p>

<p>This sort of trifling? Even had you skill</p>

<p>In speech(which I have not)to make your will</p>

<p>Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity! Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back? Nephewssons mine ... ah God, I know not! Well-She, men would have to be your mother once, Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was! What's done is done, and she is dead beside, Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since, And as she died so must we die ourselves, And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream. Life, how and what is it? As here I lie In this state-chamber, dying by degrees, Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask "Do I live, am I dead?" Peace, peace seems all. Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace; And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought</p>

<p>Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just this</p>

<p>Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,</p>

<p>Or there exceed the mark"and if she let</p>

<p>Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set</p>

<p>Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,</p>

<p>E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose</p>

<p>Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,</p>

<p>Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without</p>

<p>Much the same smile? This grew; I gave command;</p>

<p>Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands</p>

<p>As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet</p>

<p>The company below, then. I repeat,</p>

<p>The Count your master's known munificence</p>

<p>Is ample warrant that no just pretence</p>

<p>Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;</p>

<p>Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed</p>

<p>At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go</p>

<p>Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,</p>

<p>Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,</p>

<p>Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know:</p>

<p>Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care;</p>

<p>Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South</p>

<p>He graced his carrion with, God curse the same!</p>

<p>Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence</p>

<p>One sees the pulpit o' the epistle-side,</p>

<p>And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats,</p>

<p>And up into the very dome where live</p>

<p>The angels, and a sunbeam's sure to lurk:</p>

<p>And I shall fill my slab of basalt there,</p>

<p>And 'neath my tabernacle take my rest,</p>

<p>With those nine columns round me, two and two,</p>

<p>The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands:</p>

<p>Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe</p>

<p>As fresh poured red wine of a mighty pulse</p>

<p>Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone,</p>

<p>Put me where I may look at him! True peach,</p>

<p>Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize!</p>

<p>Draw close: that conflagration of my church</p>

<p>What then? So much was saved if aught were missed!</p>

<p>My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig</p>

<p>The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood,</p>

<p>Drop water gently till the surface sink,</p>

<p>And if ye find . . . Ah God, I know not, I! . . .</p>

<p>Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft,</p>

<p>And corded up in a tight olive-frail,</p>

<p>Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli,</p>

<p>Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape,</p>

<p>Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast</p>

<p>Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all,</p>

<p>That brave Frascati villa with its bath,</p>

<p>So, let the blue lump poise between my knees,</p>

<p>Like God the Father's globe on both his hands</p>

<p>Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay,</p>

<p>For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst!</p>

<p>Swift as a weaver's shuttle fleet our years:</p>

<p>Man goeth to the grave, and where is he?</p>

<p>Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black</p>

<p>'Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else</p>

<p>Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath?</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO77</p>

<p>The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me.</p>

<p>Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance</p>

<p>Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,</p>

<p>The Saviour at his sermon on the mount,</p>

<p>Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan</p>

<p>Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off,</p>

<p>And Moses with the tables . . . but I know</p>

<p>Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee,</p>

<p>Child of my bowels, Anselm ? Ah, ye hope</p>

<p>To revel down my villas while I gasp</p>

<p>Bricked o'er with beggar's mouldy travertine</p>

<p>Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at!</p>

<p>Nay, boys, ye love meall of jasper, then!</p>

<p>'Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve.</p>

<p>My bath must needs be left behind, alas!</p>

<p>One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut,</p>

<p>There's plenty jasper somewhere in the world</p>

<p>And have I not Saint Praxed's ear to pray</p>

<p>Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts,</p>

<p>And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs?</p>

<p>That's if ye carve my epitaph aright,</p>

<p>Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word,</p>

<p>No gaudy ware like Gandolf's second line</p>

<p>Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need!</p>

<p>And then how I shall lie through centuries,</p>

<p>And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,</p>

<p>And see God made and eaten all day long,</p>

<p>And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste</p>

<p>Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!</p>

<p>For as I lie here, hours of the dead night,</p>

<p>Dying in state and by such slow degrees,</p>

<p>I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook,</p>

<p>And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point,</p>

<p>And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop</p>

<p>Into great laps and folds of sculptor's work:</p>

<p>And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts</p>

<p>Grow, with a certain humming in my ears,</p>

<p>About the life before I lived this life,</p>

<p>And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests,</p>

<p>Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount,</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes,</p>

<p>And new-found agate urns as fresh as day,</p>

<p>And marble's language, Latin pure, discreet,</p>

<p>Aha, elucescebat quoth our friend?</p>

<p>No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best!</p>

<p>Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage.</p>

<p>All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope</p>

<p>My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart?</p>

<p>Ever your eyes were as a lizard's quick,</p>

<p>They glitter like your mother's for my soul,</p>

<p>Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze,</p>

<p>Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase</p>

<p>With grapes, and add a visor and a Term,</p>

<p>And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx</p>

<p>That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down,</p>

<p>To comfort me on my entablature</p>

<p>Whereon I am to lie till I must ask</p>

<p>"Do I live, am I dead?" There, leave me, there!</p>

<p>For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude</p>

<p>To deathye wish itGod, ye wish it!  Stone</p>

<p>Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat</p>

<p>As if the corpse they keep were oozing through</p>

<p>And no more lapis to delight the world!</p>

<p>Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there,</p>

<p>But in a row: and, going, turn your backs</p>

<p>Ay, like departing altar-ministrants,</p>

<p>And leave me in my church, the church for peace,</p>

<p>That I may watch at leisure if he leers</p>

<p>Old Gandolfat me, from his onion-stone,</p>

<p>As still he envied me, so fair she was!</p>

<p>Evelyn Hope Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead!</p>

<p>Sit and watch by her side an hour. That is her book-shelf, this her bed;</p>

<p>She plucked that piece of geranium-flower, Beginning to die too, in the glass;</p>

<p>Little has yet been changed, I think: The shutters are shut, no light may pass</p>

<p>Save two long rays through the hinge's chink.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO79</p>

<p>Sixteen years old when she died!</p>

<p>Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name; It was not her time to love; beside,</p>

<p>Her life had many a hope and aim, Duties enough and little cares,</p>

<p>And now was quiet, now astir, Till God's hand beckoned unawares,</p>

<p>And the sweet white brow is all of her.</p>

<p>Is it too late then, Evelyn Hope ?</p>

<p>What, your soul was pure and true, The good stars met in your horoscope,</p>

<p>Made you of spirit, fire and dew And, just because I was thrice as old</p>

<p>And our paths in the world diverged so wide, Each was naught to each, must I be told?</p>

<p>We were fellow mortals, naught beside?</p>

<p>No, indeed! for God above</p>

<p>Is great to grant, as mighty to make, And creates the love to reward the love:</p>

<p>I claim you still, for my own love's sake! Delayed it may be for more lives yet,</p>

<p>Through worlds I shall traverse, not a few: Much is to learn, much to forget</p>

<p>Ere the time be come for taking you.</p>

<p>But the time will comeat last it will,</p>

<p>When, Evelyn Hope, what meant (I shall say) In the lower earth, in the years long still,</p>

<p>That body and soul so pure and gay? Why your hair was amber, I shall divine,</p>

<p>And your mouth of your own geranium's red And what you would do with me, in fine,</p>

<p>In the new life come in the old life's stead.</p>

<p>I have lived (I shall say) so much since then,</p>

<p>Given up myself so many times, Gained me the gains of various men,</p>

<p>Ransacked the ages, spoiled the climes;</p>

<p>io8o</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>Yet one thing, one, in my soul's full scope,</p>

<p>Either I missed or itself missed me: And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope!</p>

<p>What is the issue? Let us see!</p>

<p>I loved you, Evelyn, all the while!</p>

<p>My heart seemed full as it could hold; There was place and to spare for the frank young smile,</p>

<p>And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold. So, hush,I will give you this leaf to keep:</p>

<p>See, I shut it inside the sweet cold hand! There, that is our secret: go to sleep!</p>

<p>You will wake, and remember, and understand.</p>

<p>67/ A Toccata of Galuppi's</p>

<p>Oh Galuppi, Baldassare, this is very sad to find!</p>

<p>I can hardly misconceive you; it would prove me deaf and blind;</p>

<p>But although I take your meaning, 'tis with such a heavy mind!</p>

<p>Here you come with your old music, and here's all the good it brings. What, they lived once thus at Venice where the merchants were the kings, Where St. Mark's is, where the Doges used to wed the sea with rings?</p>

<p>Ay, because the sea's the street there, and 'tis arched by . . . what you call</p>

<p>. . . Shylock's bridge with houses on it, where they kept the carnival: I was never out of Englandit's as if I saw it all.</p>

<p>Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in May? Balls and masks begun at midnight, burning ever to mid-day, When they made up fresh adventures for the morrow, do you say?</p>

<p>Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,</p>

<p>On her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed,</p>

<p>O'er the breast's superb abundance where a man might base his head?</p>

<p>Well, and it was graceful of themthey'd break talk off and afford -She, to bite her mask's black velvethe, to finger on his sword, While you sat and played Toccatas, stately at the clavichord ?</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>I08l</p>

<p>What? Those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on sigh, Told them something? Those suspensions, those solutions"Must we die?"</p>

<p>Those commiserating sevenths"Life might last! we can but try!"</p>

<p>"Were you happy?""Yes.""And are you still as happy?""Yes. And you?"</p>

<p>"Then, more kisses!""Did / stop them, when a million seemed so few ?"</p>

<p>Hark, the dominant's persistence till it must be answered to!</p>

<p>So, an octave struck the answer. Oh, they praised you, I dare say! "Brave Galuppi! that was music! good alike at grave and gay! I can always leave off talking when I hear a master play!"</p>

<p>Then they left you for their pleasure: till in due time, one by one, Some with lives that came to nothing, some with deeds as well undone, Death stepped tacidy and took them where they never see the sun.</p>

<p>But when I sit down to reason, think to take my stand nor swerve, While I triumph o'er a secret wrung from nature's close reserve, In you come with your cold music till I creep through every nerve.</p>

<p>Yes, you, like a ghostly cricket, creaking where a house was burned: "Dust and ashes, dead and done with, Venice spent what Venice earned. The soul, doubtless, is immortalwhere a soul can be discerned.</p>

<p>"Yours for instance: you know physics, something of geology, Mathematics are your pastime; souls shall rise in their degree; Butterflies may dread extinction,you'll not die, it cannot be!</p>

<p>"As for Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and drop,</p>

<p>Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the crop:</p>

<p>What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop?</p>

<p>"Dust and ashes!" So you creak it, and I want the heart to scold. Dear dear women, with such hair, toowhat's become of all the gold Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown old.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>672 Memorabilia</p>

<p>Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,</p>

<p>And did he stop and speak to you, And did you speak to him again?</p>

<p>How strange it seems and newl</p>

<p>But you were living before that,</p>

<p>And also you are living after; And the memory I started at</p>

<p>My starting moves your laughter!</p>

<p>I crossed a moor, with a name of its own And a certain use in the world no doubt,</p>

<p>Yet a hand's-breadth of it shines alone 'Mid the blank miles round about:</p>

<p>For there I picked up on the heather And there I put inside my breast</p>

<p>A moulted feather, an eagle-feather! Well, I forget the rest.</p>

<p>67J The Patriot</p>

<p>AN old story</p>

<p>It was roses, roses, all the way,</p>

<p>With myrtle mixed in my path like mad:</p>

<p>The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway, The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,</p>

<p>A year ago on this very day.</p>

<p>The air broke into a mist with bells,</p>

<p>The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.</p>

<p>Had I said, "Good folk, mere noise repels But give me your sun from yonder skies!"</p>

<p>They had answered, "And afterward, what else?"</p>

<p>Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun To give it my loving friends to keep!</p>

<p>Naught man could do, have I left undone: And you see my harvest, what I reap</p>

<p>This very day, now a year is run.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>IO83</p>

<p>There's nobody on the house-tops now Just a palsied few at the windows set;</p>

<p>For the best of the sight is, all allow, At the Shambles' Gateor, better yet,</p>

<p>By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.</p>

<p>I go in the rain, and, more than needs, A rope cuts both my wrists behind;</p>

<p>And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds, For they fling, whoever has a mind,</p>

<p>Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.</p>

<p>Thus I entered, and thus I go!</p>

<p>In triumphs, people have dropped down dead. "Paid by the world, what dost thou owe</p>

<p>Me?"God might question; now instead, 'Tis God shall repay: I am safer so.</p>

<p>A Grammarian's Funeral shortly after the revival of learning in europe Let us begin and carry up this corpse,</p>

<p>Singing together. Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes</p>

<p>Each in its tether Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,</p>

<p>Cared-for till cock-crow: Look out if yonder be not day again</p>

<p>Rimming the rock-row! That's the appropriate country; there, man's thought,</p>

<p>Rarer, intenser, Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,</p>

<p>Chafes in the censer. Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop:</p>

<p>Seek we sepulture On a tall mountain, citied to the top,</p>

<p>Crowded with culture! All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;</p>

<p>Clouds overcome it; No! yonder sparkle is the citadel's</p>

<p>Circling its summit.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights;</p>

<p>Wait ye the warning? Our low life was the level's and the night's;</p>

<p>He's for the morning. Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,</p>

<p>'Ware the beholders! This is our master, famous, calm and dead,</p>

<p>Borne on our shoulders.</p>

<p>Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft,</p>

<p>Safe from the weather! He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,</p>

<p>Singing together, He was a man born with thy face and throat,</p>

<p>Lyric Apollo! Long he lived nameless: how should Spring take note</p>

<p>Winter would follow? Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!</p>

<p>Cramped and diminished, Moaned he, "New measures, other feet anon!</p>

<p>My dance is finished?" No, that's the world's way: (keep the mountainside,</p>

<p>Make for the city!) He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride</p>

<p>Over men's pity; Left play for work, and grappled with the world</p>

<p>Bent on escaping: "What's in the scroll," quoth he, "thou keepest furled?</p>

<p>Show me their shaping, Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage,</p>

<p>Give!"So, he gowned him, Straight got by heart that book to its last page:</p>

<p>Learned, we found him. Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,</p>

<p>Accents uncertain: "Time to taste life," another would have said,</p>

<p>"Up with the curtain!" This man said rather, "Actual life comes next?</p>

<p>Patience a moment!</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING I085</p>

<p>Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed text,</p>

<p>Still there's the comment. Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,</p>

<p>Painful or easy! Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the feast,</p>

<p>Ay, nor feel queasy." Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,</p>

<p>When he had learned it, When he had gathered all books had to give!</p>

<p>Sooner, he spurned it. Image the whole, then execute the parts</p>

<p>Fancy the fabric Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,</p>

<p>Ere mortar dab brick!</p>

<p>(Here's the town-gate reached: there's the market-place</p>

<p>Gaping before us.) Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace</p>

<p>(Hearten our chorus!) That before living he'd learn how to live</p>

<p>No end to learning: Earn the means firstGod surely will contrive</p>

<p>Use for our earning. Others mistrust and say, "But time escapes:</p>

<p>Live now or never!" He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!</p>

<p>Man has Forever." Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:</p>

<p>Calculus racked him: Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:</p>

<p>Tussis attacked him. "Now, master, take a little rest!"not he!</p>

<p>(Caution redoubled, Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)</p>

<p>Not a whit troubled, Back to his studies, fresher than at first,</p>

<p>Fierce as a dragon He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)</p>

<p>Sucked at the flagon.</p>

<p>io86</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>Oh, if we draw a circle premature,</p>

<p>Heedless of far gain, Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure</p>

<p>Bad is our bargain! Was it not great? did not he throw on God,</p>

<p>(He loves the burthen) God's task to make the heavenly period</p>

<p>Perfect the earthen? Did not he magnify the mind, show clear</p>

<p>Just what it all meant? He would not discount life, as fools do here,</p>

<p>Paid by instalment. He ventured neck or nothingheaven's success</p>

<p>Found, or earth's failure: "Wilt thou trust death or not?" He answered "Yes!</p>

<p>Hence with life's pale lure!" That low man seeks a little thing to do,</p>

<p>Sees it and does it: This high man, with a great thing to pursue,</p>

<p>Dies ere he knows it. That low man goes on adding one to one,</p>

<p>His hundred's soon hit: This high man, aiming at a million,</p>

<p>Misses an unit. That, has the world hereshould he need the next,</p>

<p>Let the world mind him! This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed</p>

<p>Seeking shall find him. So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,</p>

<p>Ground he at grammar; Still, through the rattle, parts of speech were rife:</p>

<p>While he could stammer He settled Hod's businesslet it be!</p>

<p>Properly based Oun Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De,</p>

<p>Dead from the waist down. Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:</p>

<p>Hail to your purlieus, All ye highfliers of the feathered race,</p>

<p>Swallows and curlews!</p>

<p>robert browning I087</p>

<p>Here's the top-peak; the multitude below</p>

<p>Live, for they can, there: This man decided not to Live but Know</p>

<p>Bury this man there? Herehere's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,</p>

<p>Lightnings are loosened, Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,</p>

<p>Peace let the dew send! Lofty designs must close in like effects:</p>

<p>Loftily lying, Leave himstill loftier than the world suspects,</p>

<p>Living and dying.</p>

<p>Andrea Del Sarto</p>

<p>called "the faultless painter"</p>

<p>But do not let us quarrel any more, No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once: Sit down and all shall happen as you wish. You turn your face, but does it bring your heart? I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear, Treat his own subject after his own way, Fix his own time, accept too his own price, And shut the money into this small hand When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly? Oh, I'll content him,but to-morrow, Love! I often am much wearier than you think, This evening more than usual, and it seems As ifforgive nowshould you let me sit Here by the window with your hand in mine And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole, Both of one mind, as married people use, Quietly, quietly the evening through, I might get up to-morrow to my work Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try. To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this! Your soft hand is a woman of itself, And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve For each of the five pictures we require:</p>

<p>1088 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>It saves a model. So! keep looking so</p>

<p>My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds!</p>

<p>How could you ever prick those perfect ears,</p>

<p>Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet</p>

<p>My face, my moon, my everybody's moon,</p>

<p>Which everybody looks on and calls his,</p>

<p>And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn,</p>

<p>While she looksno one's: very dear, no less.</p>

<p>You smile? why, there's my picture ready made,</p>

<p>There's what we painters call our harmony!</p>

<p>A common grayness silvers everything,</p>

<p>All in a twilight, you and I alike</p>

<p>You, at the point of your first pride in me</p>

<p>(That's gone you know),but I, at every point;</p>

<p>My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down</p>

<p>To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole.</p>

<p>There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top;</p>

<p>That length of convent-wall across the way</p>

<p>Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;</p>

<p>The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,</p>

<p>And autumn grows, autumn in everything.</p>

<p>Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape</p>

<p>As if I saw alike my work and self</p>

<p>And all that I was born to be and do,</p>

<p>A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand.</p>

<p>How strange now looks the life he makes us lead;</p>

<p>So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!</p>

<p>I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie!</p>

<p>This chamber for exampleturn your head</p>

<p>All that's behind us! You don't understand</p>

<p>Nor care to understand about my art,</p>

<p>But you can hear at least when people speak:</p>

<p>And that cartoon, the second from the door</p>

<p>It is the thing, Love! so such things should be</p>

<p>Behold Madonna!I am bold to say.</p>

<p>I can do with my pencil what I know,</p>

<p>What I see, what at bottom of my heart</p>

<p>I wish for, if I ever wish so deep</p>

<p>Do easily, toowhen I say, perfectly,</p>

<p>I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING I089</p>

<p>Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, And just as much they used to say in France. At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: I do what many dream of all their lives, Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, And fail in doing. I could count twenty such On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, Who striveyou don't know how the others strive To paint a litde thing like that you smeared Carelessly passing with your robes afloat, Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says, (I know his name, no matter)so much less! Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. There burns a truer light of God in them, In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, Enter and take their place there sure enough, Though they come back and cannot tell the world. My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. The sudden blood of these men! at a word Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. I, painting from myself and to myself, Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame Or their praise either. Somebody remarks Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-gray Placid and perfect with my art: the worse! I know both what I want and what might gain, And yet how profitless to know, to sigh 'Had I been two, another and myself, Our head would have o'erlooked the world!" No doubt Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>The Urbinate who died five years ago.</p>

<p>('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)</p>

<p>Well, I can fancy how he did it all,</p>

<p>Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,</p>

<p>Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,</p>

<p>Above and through his artfor it gives way;</p>

<p>That arm is wrongly putand there again</p>

<p>A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines,</p>

<p>Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,</p>

<p>He means rightthat, a child may understand.</p>

<p>Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:</p>

<p>But all the play, the insight and the stretch</p>

<p>Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out?</p>

<p>Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,</p>

<p>We might have risen to Rafael, I and you!</p>

<p>Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think</p>

<p>More than I merit, yes, by many times.</p>

<p>But had youoh, with the same perfect brow,</p>

<p>And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,</p>

<p>And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird</p>

<p>The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare</p>

<p>Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!</p>

<p>Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged</p>

<p>"God and the glory! never care for gain,</p>

<p>The present by the future, what is that ?</p>

<p>Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!</p>

<p>Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"</p>

<p>I might have done it for you. So it seems:</p>

<p>Perhaps not. All is as God overrules.</p>

<p>Beside, incentives come from the soul's self;</p>

<p>The rest avail not. Why do I need you?</p>

<p>What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?</p>

<p>In this world, who can do a thing, will not;</p>

<p>And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:</p>

<p>Yet the will's somewhatsomewhat, too, the power</p>

<p>And thus we half-men struggle. At the end,</p>

<p>God, I conclude, compensates, punishes.</p>

<p>'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,</p>

<p>That I am something underrated here,</p>

<p>Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IOQJ</p>

<p>I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,</p>

<p>For fear of chancing on the Paris lords.</p>

<p>The best is when they pass and look aside;</p>

<p>But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.</p>

<p>Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time,</p>

<p>And that long festal year at Fontainebleau!</p>

<p>I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,</p>

<p>Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear,</p>

<p>In that humane great monarch's golden look,</p>

<p>One finger in his beard or twisted curl</p>

<p>Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile,</p>

<p>One arm about my shoulder, round my neck,</p>

<p>The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,</p>

<p>I painting proudly with his breath on me,</p>

<p>All his court round him, seeing with his eyes,</p>

<p>Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls</p>

<p>Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,</p>

<p>And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,</p>

<p>This in the background, waiting on my work,</p>

<p>To crown the issue with a last reward!</p>

<p>A good time, was it not, my kingly days?</p>

<p>And had you not grown restless . . . but I know</p>

<p>'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my instinct said;</p>

<p>Too live the life grew, golden and not gray,</p>

<p>And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt</p>

<p>Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.</p>

<p>How could it end in any other way?</p>

<p>You called me, and I came home to your heart.</p>

<p>The triumph wasto reach and stay there; since</p>

<p>I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?</p>

<p>Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold,</p>

<p>You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!</p>

<p>"Rafael did this, Andrea painted that;</p>

<p>The Roman's is the better when you pray,</p>

<p>But still the other's Virgin was his wife"</p>

<p>Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge</p>

<p>Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows</p>

<p>My better fortune, I resolve to think.</p>

<p>For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives,</p>

<p>Said one day Agnolo, his very self,</p>

<p>IO92 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>To Rafael ... I have known it all these years . . .</p>

<p>(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts</p>

<p>Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see,</p>

<p>Too lifted up in heart because of it)</p>

<p>"Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub</p>

<p>Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,</p>

<p>Who, were he set to plan and execute</p>

<p>As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,</p>

<p>Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!"</p>

<p>To Rafael's!And indeed the arm is wrong.</p>

<p>I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see,</p>

<p>Give the chalk herequick, thus the line should go!</p>

<p>Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out!</p>

<p>Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,</p>

<p>(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo?</p>

<p>Do you forget already words like those?)</p>

<p>If really there was such a chance, so lost,</p>

<p>Is, whether you'renot gratefulbut more pleased.</p>

<p>Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed!</p>

<p>This hour has been an hour! Another smile?</p>

<p>If you would sit thus by me every night</p>

<p>I should work better, do you comprehend?</p>

<p>I mean that I should earn more, give you more.</p>

<p>See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star;</p>

<p>Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall,</p>

<p>The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.</p>

<p>Come from the window, love,come in, at last,</p>

<p>Inside the melancholy little house</p>

<p>We built to be so gay with. God is just.</p>

<p>King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights</p>

<p>When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,</p>

<p>The walls become illumined, brick from brick</p>

<p>Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold,</p>

<p>That gold of his I did cement them with!</p>

<p>Let us but love each other. Must you go ?</p>

<p>That Cousin here again? he waits outside?</p>

<p>Must see youyou, and not with me? Those loans?</p>

<p>More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that?</p>

<p>Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend ?</p>

<p>While hand and eye and something of a heart</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO93</p>

<p>Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth ?</p>

<p>I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit</p>

<p>The gray remainder of the evening out,</p>

<p>Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly</p>

<p>How I could paint, were I but back in France,</p>

<p>One picture, just one morethe Virgin's face.</p>

<p>Not yours this time! I want you at my side</p>

<p>To hear themthat is, Michel Agnolo</p>

<p>Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.</p>

<p>Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend.</p>

<p>I take the subjects for his corridor,</p>

<p>Finish the portrait out of handthere, there,</p>

<p>And throw him in another thing or two</p>

<p>If he demurs; the whole should prove enough</p>

<p>To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside,</p>

<p>What's better and what's all I care about,</p>

<p>Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff!</p>

<p>Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he,</p>

<p>The Cousin, what does he to please you more?</p>

<p>I am grown peaceful as old age to-night. I regret little, I would change still less. Since there my past life lies, why alter it? The very wrong to Francis!it is true I took his coin, was tempted and complied, And built this house and sinned, and all is said. My father and my mother died of want. Well, had I riches of my own? you see How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot. They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died; And I have labored somewhat in my time And not been paid profusely. Some good son Paint my two hundred pictureslet him try! No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes. You loved me quite enough, it seems to-night. This must suffice me here. What would one have? In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance Four great walls in the New Jerusalem, Meted on each side by the angel's reed, For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me</p>

<p>1094 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>* To coverthe three first without a wife, While I have mine! Sostill they overcome Because there's still Lucrezia,as I choose.</p>

<p>Again the Cousin's whistle! Go, my Love.</p>

<p>676 One Word More</p>

<p>to e. b. b. London, September, 1S55</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>There they are, my fifty men and women Naming me the fifty poems finished! Take them, Love, the book and me together: Where the heart lies, let the brain lie also.</p>

<p>11</p>

<p>Rafael made a century of sonnets,</p>

<p>Made and wrote them in a certain volume</p>

<p>Dinted with the silver-pointed pencil</p>

<p>Else he only used to draw Madonnas:</p>

<p>These, the world might viewbut one, the volume.</p>

<p>Who that one, you ask ? Your heart instructs you.</p>

<p>Did she live and love it all her lifetime</p>

<p>Did she drop, his lady of the sonnets,</p>

<p>Die, and let it drop beside her pillow</p>

<p>Where it lay in place of Rafael's glory,</p>

<p>Rafael's cheek so duteous and so loving,</p>

<p>Cheek, the world was wont to hail a painter's,</p>

<p>Rafael's cheek, her love had turned a poet's?</p>

<p>hi</p>

<p>You and I would rather read that volume, (Taken to his beating bosom by it) Lean and list the bosom-beats of Rafael, Would we not? than wonder at Madonnas Her, San Sisto names, and Her, Foligno, Her, that visits Florence in a vision, Her, that's left with lilies in the Louvre Seen by us and all the world in circle.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>You and I will never read that volume.</p>

<p>Guido Reni, like his own eye's apple</p>

<p>Guarded long the treasure-book and loved it.</p>

<p>Guido Reni dying, all Bologna</p>

<p>Cried, and the world cried too, "Ours, the treasure!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, as rare things will, it vanished.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>Dante once prepared to paint an angel:</p>

<p>Whom to please? You whisper "Beatrice." While he mused and traced it and retraced it, (Peradventure with a pen corroded Still by drops of that hot ink he dipped for, When, his left-hand i' the hair o' the wicked, Back he held the brow and pricked its stigma, Bit into the live man's flesh for parchment, Loosed him, laughed to see the writing rankle, Let the wretch go festering through Florence) Dante, who loved well because he hated, Hated wickedness that hinders loving, Dante standing, studying his angel, In there broke the folk of his Inferno. Says he"Certain people of importance" (Such he gave his daily dreadful line to) "Entered and would seize, forsooth, the poet." Says the poet"Then I stopped my painting."</p>

<p>vi</p>

<p>You and I would rather see that angel, Painted by the tenderness of Dante, Would we not?than read a fresh Inferno.</p>

<p>vii</p>

<p>You and I will never see that picture. While he mused on love and Beatrice, While he softened o'er his outlined angel, In they broke, those "people of importance:" We and Bice bear the loss forever.</p>

<p>robert browning</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>What of Rafael's sonnets, Dante's picture?</p>

<p>This: no artist lives and loves, that longs not</p>

<p>Once, and only once, and for one only,</p>

<p>(Ah, the prize!) to find his love a language</p>

<p>Fit and fair and simple and sufficient</p>

<p>Using nature that's an art to others,</p>

<p>Not, this one time, art that's turned his nature,</p>

<p>Ay, of all the artists living, loving,</p>

<p>None but would forego his proper dowry,</p>

<p>Does he paint? he fain would write a poem,</p>

<p>Does he write? he fain would paint a picture,</p>

<p>Put to proof art alien to the artist's,</p>

<p>Once, and only once, and for one only,</p>

<p>So to be the man and leave the artist,</p>

<p>Gain the man's joy, miss the artist's sorrow.</p>

<p>ix</p>

<p>Wherefore? Heaven's gift takes earth's abatement!</p>

<p>He who smites the rock and spreads the water,</p>

<p>Bidding drink and live a crowd beneath him,</p>

<p>Even he, the minute makes immortal,</p>

<p>Proves, perchance, but mortal in the minute.</p>

<p>Desecrates, belike, the deed in doing.</p>

<p>While he smites, how can he but remember,</p>

<p>So he smote before, in such a peril,</p>

<p>When they stood and mocked"Shall smiting help us?'</p>

<p>When they drank and sneered"A stroke is easy!"</p>

<p>When they wiped their mouths and went their journey</p>

<p>Throwing him for thanks"But drought was pleasant.'</p>

<p>Thus old memories mar the actual triumph;</p>

<p>Thus the doing savors of disrelish;</p>

<p>Thus achievement lacks a gracious somewhat;</p>

<p>O'er-importuned brows becloud the mandate,</p>

<p>Carelessness or consciousnessthe gesture.</p>

<p>For he bears an ancient wrong about him,</p>

<p>Sees and knows again those phalanxed faces,</p>

<p>Hears, yet one time more, the 'customed prelude</p>

<p>"How shouldst thou, of all men, smite, and save us?"</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IO97</p>

<p>Guesses what is like to prove the sequel "Egypt's flesh potsnay, the drought was better."</p>

<p>x</p>

<p>Oh, the crowd must have emphatic warrant! Theirs, the Sinai-forehead's cloven brilliance, Right-arm's rod-sweep, tongue's imperial fiat. Never dares the man put off the prophet.</p>

<p>xi</p>

<p>Did he love one face from out the thousands, (Were she Jethro's daughter, white and wifely, Were she but the ^Ethiopian bondslave,) He would envy yon dumb patient camel, Keeping a reserve of scanty water Meant to save his own life in the desert; Ready in the desert to deliver (Kneeling down to let his breast be opened) Hoard and life together for his mistress.</p>

<p>xii</p>

<p>I shall never, in the years remaining,</p>

<p>Paint you pictures, no, nor carve you statues,</p>

<p>Make you music that should all-express me;</p>

<p>So it seems: I stand on my attainment.</p>

<p>This of verse alone, one life allows me;</p>

<p>Verse and nothing else have I to give you.</p>

<p>Other heights in other lives, God willing:</p>

<p>All the gifts from all the heights, your own, Love!</p>

<p>xiii</p>

<p>Yet a semblance of resource avails us Shade so finely touched, love's sense must seize it. Take these lines, look lovingly and nearly, Lines I write the first time and the last time. He who works in fresco, steals a hairbrush, Curbs the liberal hand, subservient proudly, Cramps his spirit, crowds its all in little, Makes a strange art of an art familiar, Fills his lady's missal-marge with flowerets.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>He who blows through bronze, may breathe through sil</p>

<p>Fitly serenade a slumbrous princess.</p>

<p>He who writes, may write for once as I do.</p>

<p>XIV</p>

<p>Love, you saw me gather men and women, Live or dead or fashioned by my fancy, Enter each and all, and use their service, Speak from every mouth,the speech, a poem. Hardly shall I tell my joys and sorrows, Hope and fears, belief and disbelieving: I am mine and yoursthe rest be all men's, Karshish, Cleon, Norbert, and the fifty, Let me speak this once in my true person, Not as Lippo, Roland, or Andrea, Though the fruit of speech be just this sentence: Pray you, look on these my men and women, Take and keep my fifty poems finished; Where my heart lies, let my brain lie also! Poor the speech; be how I speak, for all things.</p>

<p>xv</p>

<p>Not but that you know me! Lo, the moon's self! Here in London, yonder late in Florence, Still we find her face, the thrice-transfigured, Curving on a sky imbrued with color, Drifted over Fiesole by twilight, Came she, our new crescent of a hair's-breadth. Full she flared it, lamping Samminiato, Rounder 'twixt the cypresses and rounder, Perfect till the nightingales applauded. Now, a piece of her old self, impoverished, Hard to greet, she traverses the houseroofs, Hurries with unhandsome thrift of silver, Goes dispiritedly, glad to finish.</p>

<p>xvi</p>

<p>What, there's nothing in the moon noteworthy? Nay: for if that moon could love a mortal, Use, to charm him (so to fit a fancy),</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>All her magic ('tis the old sweet mythos),</p>

<p>She would turn a new side to her mortal,</p>

<p>Side unseen of herdsman, huntsman, steersman</p>

<p>Blank to Zoroaster on his terrace,</p>

<p>Blind to Galileo on his turret,</p>

<p>Dumb to Homer, dumb to Keatshim, even!</p>

<p>Think, the wonder of the moonstruck mortal</p>

<p>When she turns round, comes again in heaven,</p>

<p>Opens out anew for worse or better!</p>

<p>Proves she like some portent of an iceberg</p>

<p>Swimming full upon the ship it founders,</p>

<p>Hungry with huge teeth of splintered crystals?</p>

<p>Proves she as the paved work of a sapphire</p>

<p>Seen by Moses when he climbed the mountain?</p>

<p>Moses, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu</p>

<p>Climbed and saw the very God, the Highest,</p>

<p>Stand upon the paved work of a sapphire.</p>

<p>Like the bodied heaven in his clearness</p>

<p>Shone the stone, the sapphire of that paved work,</p>

<p>When they ate and drank and saw God also!</p>

<p>xvii</p>

<p>What were seen? None knows, none ever shall know.</p>

<p>Only this is surethe sight were other,</p>

<p>Not the moon's same side, born late in Florence,</p>

<p>Dying now impoverished here in London.</p>

<p>God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures</p>

<p>Boasts two soul-sides, one to face the world with,</p>

<p>One to show a woman when he loves her!</p>

<p>xviii</p>

<p>This I say of me, but think of you, Love!</p>

<p>This to youyourself my moon of poets!</p>

<p>Ah, but that's the world's side, there's the wonder,</p>

<p>Thus they see you, praise you, think they know you!</p>

<p>There, in turn I stand with them and praise you</p>

<p>Out of my own self, I dare to phrase it.</p>

<p>But the best is when I glide from out them,</p>

<p>Cross a step or two of dubious twilight,</p>

<p>Come out on the other side, the novel</p>

<p>1100</p>

<p>robert browning</p>

<p>Silent silver lights and darks undreamed of, Where I hush and bless myself with silence.</p>

<p>xix</p>

<p>Oh, their Rafael of the dear Madonnas, Oh, their Dante of the dread Inferno, Wrote one songand in my brain I sing it, Drew one angelborne, see, on my bosom I</p>

<p>677 Abt Vogler</p>

<p>(after he has been extemporizing upon the musical instrument of his invention)</p>

<p>Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,</p>

<p>Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work, Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed</p>

<p>Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk, Man, brute, reptile, fly,alien of end and of aim,</p>

<p>Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed, Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name,</p>

<p>And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess he loved!</p>

<p>Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,</p>

<p>This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise! Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and now combine,</p>

<p>Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise! And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell,</p>

<p>Burrow awhile and build, broad on the roots of things, Then up again swim into sight, having based me my palace well,</p>

<p>Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs.</p>

<p>And another would mount and march, like the excellent minion he was,</p>

<p>Ay, another and yet another, one crowd but with many a crest, Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,</p>

<p>Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest: For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,</p>

<p>When a great illumination surprises a festal night Outlining round and round Rome's dome from space to spire)</p>

<p>Up, the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my soul was in sight.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>iioi</p>

<p>In sight? Not half! for it seemed, it was certain, to match man's birth,</p>

<p>Nature in turn conceived, obeying an impulse as I; And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to reach the earth,</p>

<p>As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale the sky: Novel splendors burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine,</p>

<p>Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star; Meteor-moons, balls of blaze: and they did not pale nor pine,</p>

<p>For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.</p>

<p>Nay more; for there wanted not who walked in the glare and glow,</p>

<p>Presences plain in the place; or, fresh from the Protoplast, Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,</p>

<p>Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last; Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and gone,</p>

<p>But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new: What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;</p>

<p>And what is,shall I say, matched both? for I was made perfect too.</p>

<p>All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,</p>

<p>All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth, All through music and me! For think, had I painted the whole,</p>

<p>Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth: Had I written the same, made versestill, effect proceeds from cause,</p>

<p>Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told; It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,</p>

<p>Painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled:</p>

<p>But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,</p>

<p>Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are! And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,</p>

<p>That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star. Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is naught:</p>

<p>It is everywhere in the worldloud, soft, and all is said: Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought:</p>

<p>And there! Ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the head!</p>

<p>Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;</p>

<p>Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow; For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,</p>

<p>That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go,</p>

<p>1102</p>

<p>robert browning</p>

<p>Never to be again! But many more of the kind</p>

<p>As good, nay, better, perchance: is this your comfort to me?</p>

<p>To me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind</p>

<p>To the same, same self, same love, same God: ay, what was, shall be.</p>

<p>Therefore to whom turn I but to thee, the ineffable Name?</p>

<p>Builder and maker, thou, of houses not made with hands! What, have fear of change from thee who art ever the same?</p>

<p>Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands? There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;</p>

<p>The evil is null, is naught, is silence implying sound; What was good shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;</p>

<p>On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven a perfect round.</p>

<p>All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;</p>

<p>Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist</p>

<p>When eternity affirms the conception of an hour, The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,</p>

<p>The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky, Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;</p>

<p>Enough that he heard it once: we shall hear it by and by.</p>

<p>And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence</p>

<p>For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized? Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?</p>

<p>Why rushed the discords in, but that harmony should be prized? Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,</p>

<p>Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe; But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear;</p>

<p>The rest may reason and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.</p>

<p>Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:</p>

<p>I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce. Give me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,</p>

<p>Sliding by semitones till I sink to the minor,yes, And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,</p>

<p>Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep; Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,</p>

<p>The C Major of this life: so, now I will try to sleep.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>6j8 Rabbi Ben Ezra</p>

<p>Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be,</p>

<p>The last of life, for which the first was made: Our times are in his hand Who saith, "A whole I planned,</p>

<p>Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!"</p>

<p>Not that, amassing flowers,</p>

<p>Youth sighed, "Which rose make ours,</p>

<p>Which lily leave and then as best recall?"</p>

<p>Not that, admiring stars,</p>

<p>It yearned, "Nor Jove, nor Mars;</p>

<p>Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all!"</p>

<p>Not for such hopes and fears</p>

<p>Annulling youth's brief years,</p>

<p>Do I remonstrate: folly wide the mark!</p>

<p>Rather I prize the doubt</p>

<p>Low kinds exist without,</p>

<p>Finished and finite clods, untroubled by a spark.</p>

<p>Poor vaunt of life indeed,</p>

<p>Were man but formed to feed</p>

<p>On joy, to solely seek and find a feast:</p>

<p>Such feasting ended, then</p>

<p>As sure an end to men;</p>

<p>Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-crammed beast?</p>

<p>Rejoice we are allied</p>

<p>To that which doth provide</p>

<p>And not partake, effect and not receive!</p>

<p>A spark disturbs our clod;</p>

<p>Nearer we hold of God</p>

<p>Who gives, than of His tribes that take, I must believe.</p>

<p>Then, welcome each rebuff</p>

<p>That turns earth's smoothness rough,</p>

<p>Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go!</p>

<p>1104 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>Be our joys three-parts pain! Strive, and hold cheap the strain;</p>

<p>Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!</p>

<p>For thence,a paradox</p>

<p>Which comforts while it mocks,</p>

<p>Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:</p>

<p>What I aspired to be,</p>

<p>And was not, comforts me:</p>

<p>A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale.</p>

<p>What is he but a brute</p>

<p>Whose flesh has soul to suit,</p>

<p>Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play?</p>

<p>To man, propose this test</p>

<p>Thy body at its best,</p>

<p>How far can that project thy soul on its lone way?</p>

<p>Yet gifts should prove their use:</p>

<p>I own the Past profuse</p>

<p>Of power each side, perfection every turn:</p>

<p>Eyes, ears took in their dole,</p>

<p>Brain treasured up the whole;</p>

<p>Should not the heart beat once "How good to live and learn"?</p>

<p>Not once beat "Praise be thine!</p>

<p>I see the whole design,</p>

<p>I, who saw power, see now Love perfect too:</p>

<p>Perfect I call Thy plan:</p>

<p>Thanks that I was a man!</p>

<p>Maker, remake, complete,I trust what Thou shalt do!"</p>

<p>For pleasant is this flesh;</p>

<p>Our soul, in its rose-mesh</p>

<p>Pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for rest:</p>

<p>Would we some prize might hold</p>

<p>To match those manifold</p>

<p>Possessions of the brute,gain most, as we did best!</p>

<p>Let us not always say, "Spite of this flesh to-day</p>

<p>I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!"</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING II05</p>

<p>As the bird wings and sings, Let us cry, "All good things</p>

<p>Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!"</p>

<p>Therefore I summon age</p>

<p>To grant youth's heritage,</p>

<p>Life's struggle having so far reached its term:</p>

<p>Thence shall I pass, approved</p>

<p>A man, for aye removed</p>

<p>From the developed brute; a God though in the germ.</p>

<p>And I shall thereupon</p>

<p>Take rest, ere I be gone</p>

<p>Once more on my adventure brave and new:</p>

<p>Fearless and unperplexed,</p>

<p>When I wage battle next,</p>

<p>What weapons to select, what armor to indue.</p>

<p>Youth ended, I shall try</p>

<p>My gain or loss thereby;</p>

<p>Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold:</p>

<p>And I shall weigh the same,</p>

<p>Give life its praise or blame:</p>

<p>Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old.</p>

<p>For note, when evening shuts,</p>

<p>A certain moment cuts</p>

<p>The deed off, calls the glory from the gray:</p>

<p>A whisper from the west</p>

<p>Shoots"Add this to the rest,</p>

<p>Take it and try its worth: here dies another day."</p>

<p>So, still within this life,</p>

<p>Though lifted o'er its strife,</p>

<p>Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last,</p>

<p>"This rage was right i' the main,</p>

<p>That acquiescence vain:</p>

<p>The Future I may face now I have proved the Past."</p>

<p>For more is not reserved</p>

<p>To man, with soul just nerved</p>

<p>To act to-morrow what he learns to-day:</p>

<p>II06 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>Here, work enough to watch The Master work, and catch</p>

<p>Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play.</p>

<p>As it was better, youth</p>

<p>Should strive, through acts uncouth,</p>

<p>Toward making, than repose on aught found made:</p>

<p>So, better, age, exempt</p>

<p>From strife, should know, than tempt</p>

<p>Further. Thou waitedst age: wait death nor be afraid!</p>

<p>Enough now, if the Right And Good and Infinite</p>

<p>Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own, With knowledge absolute, Subject to no dispute</p>

<p>From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone.</p>

<p>Be there, for once and all, Severed great minds from small, Announced to each his station in the Past! Was I, the world arraigned, Were they, my soul disdained,</p>

<p>Right? Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last!</p>

<p>Now, who shall arbitrate?</p>

<p>Ten men love what I hate,</p>

<p>Shun what I follow, slight what I receive;</p>

<p>Ten, who in ears and eyes</p>

<p>Match me; we all surmise,</p>

<p>They this thing, and I that: whom shall my soul believe?</p>

<p>Not on the vulgar mass</p>

<p>Called "work," must sentence pass,</p>

<p>Things done, that took the eye and had the price;</p>

<p>O'er which, from level stand,</p>

<p>The low world laid its hand,</p>

<p>Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice:</p>

<p>But all, the world's coarse thumb</p>

<p>And finger failed to plumb,</p>

<p>So passed in making up the main account;</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING IIO7</p>

<p>All instincts immature, All purposes unsure,</p>

<p>That weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount:</p>

<p>Thoughts hardly to be packed Into a narrow act,</p>

<p>Fancies that broke through language and escaped; All I could never be, All, men ignored in me,</p>

<p>This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.</p>

<p>Ay, note that Potter's wheel, That metaphor! and feel</p>

<p>Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay, Thou, to whom fools propound, When the wine makes its round,</p>

<p>"Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day!"</p>

<p>Fool! All that is, at all, Lasts ever, past recall;</p>

<p>Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure: What entered into thee, That was, is, and shall be:</p>

<p>Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure.</p>

<p>He fixed thee 'mid this dance Of plastic circumstance,</p>

<p>This Present, thou, forsooth, would fain arrest: Machinery just meant To give thy soul its bent,</p>

<p>Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impressed.</p>

<p>What though the earlier grooves,</p>

<p>Which ran the laughing loves</p>

<p>Around thy base, no longer pause and press?</p>

<p>What though, about thy rim,</p>

<p>Skull-things in order grim</p>

<p>Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress?</p>

<p>Look not thou down but up! To uses of a cup,</p>

<p>The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal,</p>

<p>II08 ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>The new wine's foaming flow, The master's lips aglow!</p>

<p>Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what needst thou with earth's wheel?</p>

<p>But I need, now as then,</p>

<p>Thee, God, who mouldest men;</p>

<p>And since, not even while the whirl was worst,</p>

<p>Did Ito the wheel of life</p>

<p>With shapes and colors rife,</p>

<p>Bound dizzilymistake my end, to slake Thy thirst:</p>

<p>So, take and use Thy work: Amend what flaws may lurk,</p>

<p>What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim! My times be in Thy hand! Perfect the cup as planned!</p>

<p>Let age approve of youth, and death complete the same!</p>

<p>679 Never the Time and the Place</p>

<p>Never the time and the place And the loved one all together!</p>

<p>This pathhow soft to pace! This Maywhat magic weather!</p>

<p>Where is the loved one's face?</p>

<p>In a dream that loved one's face meets mine, But the house is narrow, the place is bleak</p>

<p>Where, outside, rain and wind combine With a furtive ear, if I strive to speak, With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek,</p>

<p>With a malice that marks each word, each sign!</p>

<p>O enemy sly and serpentine,</p>

<p>Uncoil thee from the waking man! Do I hold the Past Thus firm and fast Yet doubt if the Future hold I can? This path so soft to pace shall lead Through the magic of May to herself indeed! Or narrow if needs the house must be, Outside are the storms and strangers: we Oh, close, safe, warm, sleep I and she, I and she.</p>

<p>ROBERT BROWNING</p>

<p>1109</p>

<p>680 Dedication of the Ring and the Book</p>

<p>O lyric Love, half angel and half bird,</p>

<p>And all a wonder and a wild desire,</p>

<p>Boldest of hearts that ever braved the sun,</p>

<p>Took sanctuary within the holier blue,</p>

<p>And sang a kindred soul out to his face,</p>

<p>Yet human at the red-ripe of the heart</p>

<p>When the first summons from the darkling earth</p>

<p>Reached thee amid thy chambers, blanched their blue,</p>

<p>And bared them of the gloryto drop down,</p>

<p>To toil for man, to suffer or to die,</p>

<p>This is the same voice: can thy soul know change?</p>

<p>Hail then, and harken from the realms of help!</p>

<p>Never may I commence my song, my due</p>

<p>To God who best taught song by gift of thee,</p>

<p>Except with bent head and beseeching hand</p>

<p>That still, despite the distance and the dark,</p>

<p>What was, again may be; some interchange</p>

<p>Of grace, some splendor once thy very thought,</p>

<p>Some benediction anciently thy smile:</p>

<p>Never conclude, but raising hand and head</p>

<p>Thither where eyes, that cannot reach, yet yearn</p>

<p>For all hope, all sustainment, all reward,</p>

<p>Their utmost up and on,so blessing back</p>

<p>In those thy realms of help, that heaven thy home,</p>

<p>Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud,</p>

<p>Some wanness where, I think, thy foot may fall!</p>

<p>681 Epilogue</p>

<p>At the midnight in the silence of the sleep-time,</p>

<p>When you set your fancies free, Will they pass to whereby death, fools think, imprisoned Low he lies who once so loved you, whom you loved so, Pity me?</p>

<p>Oh to love so, be so loved, yet so mistaken!</p>

<p>What had I on earth to do With the slothful, with the mawkish, the unmanly?</p>

<p>682 Last Lines</p>

<p>No coward soul is mine, No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere:</p>

<p>I see Heaven's glories shine, And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.</p>

<p>O God within my breast, Almighty, ever-present Deity!</p>

<p>Lifethat in me has rest, As Iundying Lifehave power in Thee!</p>

<p>Vain are the thousand creeds That move men's hearts: unutterably vain;</p>

<p>Worthless as wither'd weeds, Or idlest froth amid the boundless main,</p>

<p>To waken doubt in one Holding so fast by Thine infinity;</p>

<p>So surely anchor'd on The steadfast rock of immortality.</p>

<p>Like the aimless, helpless, hopeless, did I drivel Beingwho?</p>

<p>One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,</p>

<p>Never doubted clouds would break, Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph, Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better, Sleep to wake.</p>

<p>No, at noonday in the bustle of man's work-time</p>

<p>Greet the unseen with a cheer! Bid him forward, breast and back as either should be, "Strive and thrive!" cry "Speed,fight on, fare ever There as here!"</p>

<p>ROBERT STEPHEN HAWKER</p>

<p>With wide-embracing love Thy Spirit animates eternal years,</p>

<p>Pervades and broods above, Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.</p>

<p>Though earth and man were gone, And suns and universes cease to be,</p>

<p>And Thou were left alone, Every existence would exist in Thee.</p>

<p>There is not room for Death, Nor atom that his might could render void:</p>

<p>ThouThou art Being and Breath, And what Thou art may never be destroyed.</p>

<p>The Old Stoic</p>

<p>Riches I hold in light esteem, And Love I laugh to scorn;</p>

<p>And lust of fame was but a dream, That vanish'd with the morn:</p>

<p>And if I pray, the only prayer That moves my lips for me</p>

<p>Is, 'Leave the heart that now I bear, And give me liberty!'</p>

<p>Yes, as my swift days near their goal,</p>

<p>'Tis all that I implore; In life and death a chainless soul</p>

<p>With courage to endure.</p>

<p>68$ Departure</p>

<p>It was not like your great and gracious ways I Do you, that have naught other to lament, Never, my Love, repent Of how, that July afternoon, You went,</p>

<p>With sudden, unintelligible phrase, And frighten'd eye, Upon your journey of so many days Without a single kiss, or a good-bye?</p>

<p>Heraclitus</p>

<p>They told me, Heraclitus, they told me you were dead, They brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed I wept as I remember'd how often you and I Had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky.</p>

<p>And now that thou art lying, my dear old Carian guest, A handful of grey ashes, long, long ago at rest, Still are thy pleasant voices, thy nightingales, awake; For Death, he taketh all away, but them he cannot take.</p>

<p>I knew, indeed, that you were parting soon;</p>

<p>And so we sate, within the low sun's rays,</p>

<p>You whispering to me, for your voice was weak,</p>

<p>Your harrowing praise.</p>

<p>Well, it was well</p>

<p>To hear you such things speak,</p>

<p>And I could tell</p>

<p>What made your eyes a growing gloom of love, As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove. And it was like your great and gracious ways To turn your talk on daily things, my Dear, Lifting the luminous, pathetic lash To let the laughter flash, Whilst I drew near,</p>

<p>Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear. But all at once to leave me at the last, More at the wonder than the loss aghast, With huddled, unintelligible phrase, And frighten'd eye, And go your journey of all days With not one kiss, or a good-bye, And the only loveless look the look with which you pass'd:</p>

<p>'Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways.</p>

<p>But sweet, sweet is this human life, So sweet, I fain would breathe it still:</p>

<p>Your chilly stars I can forego,</p>

<p>This warm kind world is all I know.</p>

<p>You say there is no substance here,</p>

<p>One great reality above: Back from that void I shrink in fear,</p>

<p>And child-like hide myself in love: Show me what angels feel. Till then, I cling, a mere weak man, to men.</p>

<p>You bid me lift my mean desires From faltering lips and fitful veins</p>

<p>To sexless souls, ideal quires,</p>

<p>Unwearied voices, wordless strains:</p>

<p>My mind with fonder welcome owns</p>

<p>One dear dead friend's remembered tones.</p>

<p>Forsooth the present we must give To that which cannot pass away;</p>

<p>All beauteous things for which we live By laws of time and space decay.</p>

<p>I clasp them, is because they die.</p>

<p>Watching till she wake.</p>

<p>By the craggy hill-side,</p>

<p>Through the mosses bare, They have planted thorn-trees</p>

<p>Naught but Thy presence can avail; Yet on the road Thy wheels are not, Nor on the sea Thy sail!</p>

<p>Where did you come from, baby dear? Out of the everywhere into here.</p>

<p>What makes the light in them sparkle and spin? Some of the starry spikes left in.</p>

<p>Where did you get that little tear? I found it waiting when I got here.</p>

<p>What makes your forehead so smooth and high? A soft hand stroked it as I went by.</p>

<p>What makes your cheek like a warm white rose? I saw something better than any one knows.</p>

<p>Where did you get those arms and hands? Love made itself into bonds and bands.</p>

<p>Feet, whence did you come, you darling things? From the same box as the cherubs' wings.</p>

<p>How did they all just come to be you? God thought about me, and so I grew.</p>

<p>Far back, through creeks and inlets making, Comes silent, flooding in, the main.</p>

<p>And not by eastern windows only,</p>

<p>When daylight comes, comes in the light;</p>

<p>In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly! But westward, look, the land is bright!</p>

<p>694 The Stream of Life</p>

<p>O stream descending to the sea, Thy mossy banks between,</p>

<p>The flowerets blow, the grasses grow, The leafy trees are green.</p>

<p>In garden plots the children play, The fields the labourers till,</p>

<p>And houses stand on either hand, And thou descendest still.</p>

<p>O life descending into death, Our waking eyes behold,</p>

<p>Parent and friend thy lapse attend, Companions young and old.</p>

<p>Strong purposes our minds possess, Our hearts affections fill,</p>

<p>We toil and earn, we seek and learn, And thou descendest still.</p>

<p>O end to which our currents tend,</p>

<p>Inevitable sea, To which we flow, what do we know,</p>

<p>What shall we guess of thee?</p>

<p>A roar we hear upon thy shore, As we our course fulfil;</p>

<p>Scarce we divine a sun will shine And be above us still.</p>

<p>ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH</p>

<p>In a London Square</p>

<p>Put forth thy leaf, thou lofty plane,</p>

<p>East wind and frost are safely gone; With zephyr mild and balmy rain</p>

<p>The summer comes serenely on; Earth, air, and sun and skies combine</p>

<p>To promise all that's kind and fair; But thou, O human heart of mine,</p>

<p>Be still, contain thyself, and bear.</p>

<p>December days were brief and chill,</p>

<p>The winds of March were wild and drear, And, nearing and receding still,</p>

<p>Spring never would, we thought, be here. The leaves that burst, the suns that shine,</p>

<p>Had, not the less, their certain date; And thou, O human heart of mine,</p>

<p>Be still, refrain thyself, and wait.</p>

<p>Qua Cursum Ventus</p>

<p>As ships, becalmed at eve, that lay With canvas drooping, side by side,</p>

<p>Two towers of sail at dawn of day</p>

<p>Are scarce long leagues apart descried;</p>

<p>When fell the night, upsprung the breeze, And all the darkling hours they plied,</p>

<p>Nor dreamt but each the self-same seas By each was cleaving, side by side:</p>

<p>E'en sobut why the tale reveal</p>

<p>Of those, whom year by year unchanged,</p>

<p>Brief absence joined anew to feel, Astounded, soul from soul estranged?</p>

<p>At dead of night their sails were filled, And onward each rejoicing steered</p>

<p>Ah, neither blame, for neither willed, Or wist, what first with dawn appeared!</p>

<p>1122</p>

<p>ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH</p>

<p>To veer, how vain! On, onward strain, Brave barks! In light, in darkness too,</p>

<p>Through winds and tides one compass guides: To that, and your own selves, be true.</p>

<p>But O blithe breeze; and O great seas, Though ne'er, that earliest parting past,</p>

<p>On your wide plain they join again, Together lead them home at last.</p>

<p>One port, methought, alike they sought, One purpose hold where'er they fare,</p>

<p>O bounding breeze, O rushing seas! At last, at last, unite them there!</p>

<p>697 Where Lies the Land?</p>

<p>Where lies the land to which the ship would go? Far, far ahead, is all her seamen know. And where the land she travels from? Away, Far, far behind, is all that they can say.</p>

<p>On sunny noons upon the deck's smooth face Linked arm in arm, how pleasant here to pace; Or, o'er the stern reclining, watch below The foaming wake far widening as we go.</p>

<p>On stormy nights when wild north-westers rave, How proud a thing to fight with wind and wave! The dripping sailor on the reeling mast Exults to bear, and scorns to wish it past.</p>

<p>Where lies the land to which the ship would go? Far, far ahead, is all her seamen know. And where the land she travels from ? Away, Far, far behind, is all that they can say.</p>

<p>[1822-1888}</p>

<p>608 The Forsaken Merman</p>

<p>Come, dear children, let us away;</p>

<p>Down and away below. Now my brothers call from the bay; Now the great winds shoreward blow; Now the salt tides seaward flow; Now the wild white horses play, Champ and chafe and toss in the spray,</p>

<p>Children dear, let us away. This way, this way!</p>

<p>Call her once before you go.</p>

<p>Call once yet. In a voice that she will know:</p>

<p>'Margaret! Margaret!' Children's voices should be dear (Call once more) to a mother's ear: Children's voices, wild with pain. Surely she will come again. Call her once and come away.</p>

<p>This way, this way! 'Mother dear, we cannot stay.' The wild white horses foam and fret.</p>

<p>Margaret! Margaret!</p>

<p>Come, dear children, come away down.</p>

<p>Call no more. One last look at the white-wall'd town, And the little grey church on the windy shore.</p>

<p>Then come down. She will not come though you call all day. Come away, come away.</p>

<p>Children dear, was it yesterday</p>

<p>We heard the sweet bells over the bay?</p>

<p>In the caverns where we lay,</p>

<p>1124 MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>Through the surf and through the swell, The far-off sound of a silver bell? Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep, Where the winds are all asleep; Where the spent lights quiver and gleam; Where the salt weed sways in the stream; Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round, Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground; Where the sea-snakes coil and twine, Dry their mail, and bask in the brine; Where great whales come sailing by, Sail and sail, with unshut eye, Round the world for ever and aye? When did music come this way? Children dear, was it yesterday?</p>

<p>Children dear, was it yesterday</p>

<p>(Call yet once) that she went away?</p>

<p>Once she sate with you and me, On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,</p>

<p>And the youngest sate on her knee. She comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well, When down swung the sound of the far-off bell. She sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea. She said, 'I must go, for my kinsfolk pray In the little grey church on the shore to-day. 'Twill be Easter-time in the worldah me! And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee.' I said, 'Go up, dear heart, through the waves. Say thy prayer and come back to the kind sea-caves.' She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay</p>

<p>Children dear, was it yesterday?</p>

<p>Children dear, were we long alone? 'The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.</p>

<p>Long prayers,' I said, 'in the world they say. Come,' I said, and we rose through the surf in the bay. We went up the beach, by the sandy down Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town. Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still, To the little grey church on the windy hill.</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers, But we stood without in the cold-blowing airs. We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains, And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.</p>

<p>She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:</p>

<p>'Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here.</p>

<p>Dear heart,' I said, 'we are long alone.</p>

<p>The sea grows stormy, the litde ones moan.' But, ah! she gave me never a look, For her eyes were seal'd to the holy book. Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.</p>

<p>Come away, children, call no more.</p>

<p>Come away, come down, call no more. Down, down, down;</p>

<p>Down to the depths of the sea. She sits at her wheel in the humming town,</p>

<p>Singing most joyfully. Hark what she sings: 'O joy, O joy, For the humming street, and the child with its toy. For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well.</p>

<p>For the wheel where I spun,</p>

<p>And the blessed light of the sun.'</p>

<p>And so she sings her fill,</p>

<p>Singing most joyfully,</p>

<p>Till the shuttle falls from her hand,  .</p>

<p>And the whizzing wheel stands still. She steals to the window, and looks at the sand;</p>

<p>And over the sand at the sea;</p>

<p>And her eyes are set in a stare;</p>

<p>And anon there breaks a sigh,</p>

<p>And anon there drops a tear,</p>

<p>From a sorrow-clouded eye,</p>

<p>And a heart sorrow-laden, A long, long sigh For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaideh</p>

<p>And the gleam of her golden hair.</p>

<p>Come children, come down. Come away, away, children. The hoarse wind blows colder;</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>Lights shine in the town. She will start from her slumber When gusts shake the door; She will hear the winds howling, Will hear the waves roar. We shall see, while above us The waves roar and whirl, A ceiling of amber, A pavement of pearl. Singing, 'Here came a mortal, But faithless was she: And alone dwell for ever The kings of the sea.'</p>

<p>But, children, at midnight, When soft the winds blow; When clear falls the moonlight; When spring-tides are low: When sweet airs come seaward From heaths starr'd with broom; And high rocks throw mildly On the blanch'd sands a gloom: Up the still, glistening beaches, Up the creeks we will hie; Over banks of bright seaweed The ebb-tide leaves dry. We will gaze, from the sand-hills, At the white, sleeping town; At the church on the hill-side</p>

<p>And then come back down. Singing, 'There dwells a loved one,</p>

<p>But cruel is she. She left lonely for ever</p>

<p>The kings of the sea.'</p>

<p>The Song of Callicles Through the black, rushing smoke-bursts, Thick breaks the red flame. All Etna heaves fiercely Her forest-clothed frame.</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>Not here, O Apollo! Are haunts meet for thee. But, where Helicon breaks down In cliff to the sea.</p>

<p>Where the moon-silver'd inlets Send far their light voice Up the still vale of Thisbe, O speed, and rejoice!</p>

<p>On the sward at the cliff-top, Lie strewn the white flocks; On the cliff-side, the pigeons Roost deep in the rocks.</p>

<p>In the moonlight the shepherds, Soft lull'd by the rills, Lie wrapt in their blankets, Asleep on the hills.</p>

<p>What forms are these coming So white through the gloom? What garments out-glistening The gold-flower'd broom?</p>

<p>What sweet-breathing Presence Out-perfumes the thyme? What voices enrapture The night's balmy prime?</p>

<p>Tis Apollo comes leading His choir, The Nine. The Leader is fairest, But all are divine.</p>

<p>They are lost in the hollows. They stream up again. What seeks on this mountain The glorified train?</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>They bathe on this mountain, In the spring by their road. Then on to Olympus, Their endless abode.</p>

<p>Whose praise do they mention: Of what is it told? What will be for ever. What was from of old.</p>

<p>First hymn they the Father Of all things: and then, The rest of Immortals, The action of men.</p>

<p>The Day in his hotness, The strife with the palm; The Night in her silence, The Stars in their calm.</p>

<p>700 To Marguerite</p>

<p>Yes: in the sea of life enisled,</p>

<p>With echoing straits between us thrown.</p>

<p>Dotting the shoreless watery wild, We mortal millions live alone.</p>

<p>The islands feel the enclasping flow,</p>

<p>And then their endless bounds they know.</p>

<p>But when the moon their hollows lights, And they are swept by balms of spring,</p>

<p>And in their glens, on starry nights, The nightingales divinely sing;</p>

<p>And lovely notes, from shore to shore,</p>

<p>Across the sounds and channels pour;</p>

<p>O then a longing like despair Is to their farthest caverns sent!</p>

<p>For surely once, they feel we were Parts of a single continent.</p>

<p>Now round us spreads the watery plain O might our marges meet again!</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>1129</p>

<p>Who order'd that their longing's fire Should be, as soon as kindled, cool'd?</p>

<p>Who renders vain their deep desire? A God, a God their severance ruled;</p>

<p>And bade betwixt their shores to be</p>

<p>The unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea.</p>

<p>Ahl would that I did too.</p>

<p>Her mirth the world required: She bathed it in smiles of glee.</p>

<p>But her heart was tired, tired, And now they let her be.</p>

<p>Her life was turning, turning, In mazes of heat and sound.</p>

<p>But for peace her soul was yearning, And now peace laps her round.</p>

<p>Her cabin'd, ample Spirit,</p>

<p>It flutter'd and fail'd for breath.</p>

<p>To-night it doth inherit The vasty hall of Death.</p>

<p>Others abide our question. Thou art free.</p>

<p>We ask and ask: Thou smilest and art still,</p>

<p>Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill</p>

<p>That to the stars uncrowns his majesty,</p>

<p>Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,</p>

<p>Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,</p>

<p>Spares but the cloudy border of his base</p>

<p>To the foil'd searching of mortality;</p>

<p>And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,</p>

<p>Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,</p>

<p>70/</p>

<p>Requiescat</p>

<p>Strew on her roses, roses,</p>

<p>And never a spray of yew. In quiet she reposes:</p>

<p>702</p>

<p>Shakespeare</p>

<p>1130 MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>Didst walk on earth unguess'd at. Better so!</p>

<p>All pains the immortal spirit must endure, All weakness that impairs, all griefs that bow, Find their sole voice in that victorious brow.</p>

<p>70j Rugby Chapel</p>

<p>November, 185J Coldly, sadly descends The autumn-evening. The field Strewn with its dank yellow drifts Of wither'd leaves, and the elms, Fade into dimness apace, Silent;hardly a shout From a few boys late at their play! The lights come out in the street, In the school-room windows;but cold, Solemn, unlighted, austere, Through the gathering darkness, arise The chapel-walls, in whose bound Thou, my father! art laid.</p>

<p>There thou dost lie, in the gloom</p>

<p>Of the autumn evening. But ah!</p>

<p>That word, gloom, to my mind</p>

<p>Brings thee back, in the light</p>

<p>Of thy radiant vigor, again;</p>

<p>In the gloom of November we pass'd</p>

<p>Days not dark at thy side;</p>

<p>Seasons impair'd not the ray</p>

<p>Of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear.</p>

<p>Such thou wast! and I stand</p>

<p>In the autumn evening and think</p>

<p>Of bygone autumns with thee.</p>

<p>Fifteen years have gone round Since thou arosest to tread, In the summer-morning, the road Of death, at a call unforeseen, Sudden. For fifteen years, We who till then in thy shade</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD II3I</p>

<p>Rested as under the boughs Of a mighty oak, have endured Sunshine and rain as we might, Bare, unshaded, alone, Lacking the shelter of thee.</p>

<p>O strong soul, by what shore Tarriest thou now? For that force, Surely, has not been left vain! Somewhere, surely, afar, In the sounding labor-house vast Of being, is practised that strength, Zealous, beneficent, firm!</p>

<p>Yes, in some far-shining sphere, Conscious or not of the past, Still thou performest the word Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live-Prompt, unwearied, as here! Still thou upraisest with zeal The humble good from the ground, Sternly repressest the bad! Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse Those who with half-open eyes Tread the border-land dim Twixt vice and virtue; reviv'st, Succorest!this was thy work; This was thy life upon earth.</p>

<p>What is the course of the life Of mortal men on the earth? Most men eddy about Here and thereeat and drink, Chatter and love and hate, Gather and squander, are raised Aloft, are hurl'd in the dust, Striving blindly, achieving Nothing; and then they die Perish;and no one asks Who or what they have been,</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>More than he asks what waves, In the moonlit solitudes mild Of the midmost Ocean, have swell'd, Foam'd for a moment, and gone.</p>

<p>And there are some, whom a thirst</p>

<p>Ardent, unquenchable, fires,</p>

<p>Not with the crowd to be spent,</p>

<p>Not without aim to go round</p>

<p>In an eddy of purposeless dust,</p>

<p>Effort unmeaning and vain.</p>

<p>Ah yes! some of us strive</p>

<p>Not without action to die</p>

<p>Fruitless, but something to snatch</p>

<p>From dull oblivion, nor all</p>

<p>Glut the devouring grave!</p>

<p>We, we have chosen our path</p>

<p>Path to a clear-purposed goal,</p>

<p>Path of advance!but it leads</p>

<p>A long, steep journey, through sunk</p>

<p>Gorges, o'er mountains in snow.</p>

<p>Cheerful, with friends, we set forth</p>

<p>Then on the height, comes the storm.</p>

<p>Thunder crashes from rock</p>

<p>To rock, the cataracts reply,</p>

<p>Lightnings dazzle our eyes.</p>

<p>Roaring torrents have breach'd</p>

<p>The track, the stream-bed descends</p>

<p>In the place where the wayfarer once</p>

<p>Planted his footstepthe spray</p>

<p>Boils o'er its borders! aloft</p>

<p>The unseen snow-beds dislodge</p>

<p>Their hanging ruin; alas,</p>

<p>Havoc is made in our train!</p>

<p>Friends who set forth at our side,</p>

<p>Falter, are lost in the storm.</p>

<p>We, we only are left!</p>

<p>With frowning foreheads, with lips</p>

<p>Sternly compress'd, we strain on,</p>

<p>Onand at nightfall at last</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD II33</p>

<p>Come to the end of our way, To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks; Where the gaunt and taciturn host Stands on the threshold, the wind Shaking his thin white hairs Holds his lantern to scan Our storm-beat figures, and asks: Whom in our party we bring? Whom we have left in the snow ?</p>

<p>Sadly we answer: We bring Only ourselves! we lost Sight of the rest in the storm. Hardly ourselves we fought through, Stripp'd, without friends, as we are. Friends, companions, and train, The avalanche swept from our side.</p>

<p>But thou would'st not alone Be saved, my father! alone Conquer and come to thy goal, Leaving the rest in the wild. We were weary, and we Fearful, and we in our march Fain to drop down and to die. Still thou turnedst, and still Beckonedst the trembler, and still Gavest the weary thy hand.</p>

<p>If, in the paths of the world, Stones might have wounded thy feet, Toil or dejection have tried Thy spirit, of that we saw Nothingto us thou wast still Cheerful, and helpful, and firm! Therefore to thee it was given Many to save with thyself; And, at the end of thy day, O faithful shepherd! to come, Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.</p>

<p>1134 MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>And through thee I believe In the noble and great who are gone; Pure souls honor'd and blest By former ages, who else Such, so soulless, so poor, Is the race of men whom I see Seem'd but a dream of the heart, Seem'd but a cry of desire. Yes! I believe that there lived Others like thee in the past, Not like the men of the crowd Who all round me to-day Bluster or cringe, and make life Hideous, and arid, and vile; But souls temper'd with fire, Fervent, heroic, and good, Helpers and friends of mankind.</p>

<p>Servants of God!or sons Shall I not call you? because Not as servants ye knew Your Father's innermost mind, His, who unwillingly sees One of his little ones lost Yours is the praise, if mankind Hath not as yet in its march Fainted, and fallen, and died!</p>

<p>See! In the rocks of the world Marches the host of mankind, A feeble, wavering line. Where are they tending?A God Marshall'd them, gave them their goal. Ah, but the way is so long! Years they have been in the wild! Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks, Rising all round, overawe; Factions divide them, their host Threatens to break, to dissolve. Ah, keep, keep them combined!</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>Else, of the myriads who fill That army, not one shall arrive; Sole they shall stray; in the rocks Stagger for ever in vain. Die one by one in the waste.</p>

<p>Then, in such hour of need Of your fainting, dispirited race Ye, like angels, appear, Radiant with ardor divine! Beacons of hope, ye appear! Languor is not in your heart, Weakness is not in your word, Weariness not on your brow. Ye alight in our van! at your voice, Panic, despair, flee away. Ye move through the ranks, recall The stragglers, refresh the outworn, Praise, re-inspire the brave! Order, courage, return; Eyes rekindling, and prayers, Follow your steps as ye go. Ye fill up the gaps in our files, Strengthen the wavering line, Stablish, continue our march, On, to the bound of the waste, On, to the City of God.</p>

<p>704 Memorial Verses</p>

<p>April, i85o</p>

<p>Goethe in Weimar sleeps, and Greece, Long since, saw Byron's struggle cease. But one such death remain'd to come; The last poetic voice is dumb We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb.</p>

<p>When Byron's eyes were shut in death, We bow'd our head and held our breath. He taught us little; but our soul Had felt him like the thunder's roll.</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>With shivering heart the strife we saw Of passion with eternal law; And yet with reverential awe We watch'd the fount of fiery life Which served for that Titanic strife.</p>

<p>When Goethe's death was told, we said:</p>

<p>Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head.</p>

<p>Physician of the iron age,</p>

<p>Goethe has done his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>He took the suffering human race,</p>

<p>He read each wound, each weakness clear;</p>

<p>And struck his finger on the place,</p>

<p>And said: Thou attest here, and here!</p>

<p>He look'd on Europe's dying hour</p>

<p>Of fitful dream and feverish power;</p>

<p>His eye plunged down the weltering strife,</p>

<p>The turmoil of expiring life</p>

<p>He said: The end is everywhere,</p>

<p>Art still has truth, ta\e refuge there!</p>

<p>And he was happy, if to know</p>

<p>Causes of things, and far below</p>

<p>His feet to see the lurid flow</p>

<p>Of terror, and insane distress,</p>

<p>And headlong fate, be happiness.</p>

<p>And Wordsworth!Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice! For never has such soothing voice Been to your shadowy world convey'd, Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade Heard the clear song of Orpheus come Through Hades, and the mournful gloom. Wordsworth has gone from usand ye, Ah, may ye feel his voice as we! He too upon a wintry clime Had fallenon this iron time Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears. He found us when the age had bound Our souls in its benumbing round; He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>"37</p>

<p>He laid us as we lay at birth On the cool flowery lap of earth, Smiles broke from us and we had ease; The hills were round us, and the breeze Went o'er the sun-lit fields again; Our foreheads felt the wind and rain. Our youth returned; for there was shed On spirits that had long been dead, Spirits dried up and closely furl'd, The freshness of the early world.</p>

<p>Ah! since dark days still bring to light Man's prudence and man's fiery might, Time may restore us in his course Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force; But where will Europe's latter hour Again find Wordsworth's healing power? Others will teach us how to dare, And against fear our breast to steel; Others will strengthen us to bear But who, ah! who, will make us feel? The cloud of mortal destiny, Others will front it fearlessly But who, like him, will put it by?</p>

<p>Keep fresh the grass upon his grave O Rotha, with thy living wave! Sing him thy best! for few or none Hears thy voice right, now he is gone.</p>

<p>705 Dover Beach</p>

<p>The sea is calm to-night,</p>

<p>The tide is full, the moon lies fair</p>

<p>Upon the straits;on the French coast the light</p>

<p>Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,</p>

<p>Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.</p>

<p>Come to the window, sweet is the night air!</p>

<p>Only, from the long line of spray</p>

<p>Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>

<p>Listen! you hear the grating roar</p>

<p>Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,</p>

<p>At their return, up the high strand.</p>

<p>Begin, and cease, and then again begin,</p>

<p>With tremulous cadence slow, and bring</p>

<p>The eternal note of sadness in.</p>

<p>Sophocles long ago</p>

<p>Heard it on the ^gatan, and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery; we Find also in the sound a thought, Hearing it by this distant northern sea.</p>

<p>The Sea of Faith</p>

<p>Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd. But now I only hear Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, Retreating, to the breath</p>

<p>Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world. Ah, love, let us be true</p>

<p>To one another! for the world, which seems</p>

<p>To lie before us like a land of dreams,</p>

<p>So various, so beautiful, so new,</p>

<p>Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,</p>

<p>Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;</p>

<p>And we are here as on a darkling plain</p>

<p>Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,</p>

<p>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</p>

<p>The Better Part</p>

<p>Long fed on boundless hopes, O race of man, How angrily thou spurn'st all simpler fare! "Christ," some one says, "was human as we are; No judge eyes us from Heaven, our sin to scan; We live no more, when we have done our span." "Well, then, for Christ," thou answerest, "who can care?</p>

<p>MATTHEW ARNOLD 1139</p>

<p>From sin, which Heaven records not, why forbear? Live we like brutes our life without a plan!" So answerest thou; but why not rather say: "Hath man no second life?Pitch this one highl Sits there no judge in Heaven, our sin to see? More strictly, then, the inward judge obey! Was Christ a man like us? Ah! let us try If we then, too, can be such men as he!"</p>

<p>707 Worldly Place</p>

<p>Even in a palace, life may be led well!</p>

<p>So spake the imperial sage, purest of men,</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius. But the stifling den</p>

<p>Of common life, where, crowded up pell-mell,</p>

<p>Our freedom for a little bread we sell,</p>

<p>And drudge under some foolish master's ken</p>

<p>Who rates us if we peer outside our pen</p>

<p>Match'd with a palace, is not this a hell ?</p>

<p>Even in a palace! On his truth sincere,</p>

<p>Who spoke these words, no shadow ever came;</p>

<p>And when my ill-school'd spirit is aflame</p>

<p>Some nobler, ampler stage of life to win,</p>

<p>I'll stop, and say: "There were no succor here!</p>

<p>The aids to noble life are all within."</p>

<p>708 The Last Word</p>

<p>Creep into thy narrow bed, Creep, and let no more be said! Vain thy onset! all stands fast. Thou thyself must break at last.</p>

<p>Let the long contention cease! Geese are swans, and swans are geese. Let them have it how they will! Thou art tired; best be still.</p>

<p>They out-talk'd thee, hiss'd thee, tore thee? Better men fared thus before thee; Fired their ringing shot and pass'd, Hotly chargedand sank at last.</p>

<p>GEORGE MEREDITH</p>

<p>Charge once more, then, and be dumb! Let the victors, when they come, When the forts of folly fall, Find thy body by the wall!</p>

<p>J09 Love in the Valley</p>

<p>Under yonder beech-tree single on the green-sward,</p>

<p>Couch'd with her arms behind her golden head, Knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly,</p>

<p>Lies my young love sleeping in the shade. Had I the heart to slide an arm beneath her,</p>

<p>Press her parting lips as her waist I gather slow, Waking in amazement she could not but embrace me:</p>

<p>Then would she hold me and never let me go?</p>

<p>Shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow,</p>

<p>Swift as the swallow along the river's light Circleting the surface to meet his mirror'd winglets,</p>

<p>Fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight. Shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine-tops,</p>

<p>Wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun, She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer,</p>

<p>Hard, but O the glory of the winning were she won!</p>

<p>When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror,</p>

<p>Tying up her laces, looping up her hair, Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,</p>

<p>More love should I have, and much less care. When her mother tends her before the lighted mirror,</p>

<p>Loosening her laces, combing down her curls, Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,</p>

<p>I should miss but one for many boys and girls.</p>

<p>Heardess she is as the shadow in the meadows Flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon.</p>

<p>No, she is athirst and drinking up her wonder: Earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon.</p>

<p>GEORGE MEREDITH II4I</p>

<p>Deals she an unkindness, 'tis but her rapid measure, Even as in a dance; and her smile can heal no less:</p>

<p>Like the swinging May-cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones Off a sunny border, she was made to bruise and bless.</p>

<p>Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping</p>

<p>Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star. Lone on the fir-branch, his ratde-note unvaried,</p>

<p>Brooding o'er the gloom, spins the brown evejar. Darker grows the valley, more and more forgetting:</p>

<p>So were it with me if forgetting could be will'd. Tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well-spring,</p>

<p>Tell it to forget the source that keeps it fill'd.</p>

<p>Stepping down the hill with her fair companions,</p>

<p>Arm in arm, all against the raying West, Boldly she sings, to the merry tune she marches,</p>

<p>Brave is her shape, and sweeter unpossess'd. Sweeter, for she is what my heart first awaking</p>

<p>Whisper'd the world was; morning light is she. Love that so desires would fain keep her changeless;</p>

<p>Fain would fling the net, and fain have her free.</p>

<p>Happy happy time, when the white star hovers</p>

<p>Low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew, Near the face of dawn, that draws athwart the darkness</p>

<p>Threading it with colour, like yewberries the yew. Thicker crowd the shades as the grave East deepens</p>

<p>Glowing, and with crimson a long cloud swells. Maiden still the morn is; and strange she is, and secret;</p>

<p>Strange her eyes; her cheeks are cold as cold sea-shells.</p>

<p>Sunrays, leaning on our southern hills and lighting</p>

<p>Wild cloud-mountains that drag the hills along, Oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter</p>

<p>Chill as a dull face frowning on a song. Ay, but shows the South-west a ripple-feather'd bosom</p>

<p>Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend Scaling the mid-heavens as they stream, there comes a sunset</p>

<p>Rich, deep like love in beauty without end.</p>

<p>1142 GEORGE MEREDITH</p>

<p>When at dawn she sighs, and like an infant to the window</p>

<p>Turns grave eyes craving light, released from dreams, Beautiful she looks, like a white water-lily</p>

<p>Bursting out of bud in havens of the streams. When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle</p>

<p>In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May, Beautiful she looks, like a tall garden-lily</p>

<p>Pure from the night, and splendid for the day.</p>

<p>Mother of the dews, dark eye-lash'd twilight,</p>

<p>Low-lidded twilight, o'er the valley's brim, Rounding on thy breast sings the dew-delighted skylark,</p>

<p>Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him. Hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet,</p>

<p>Fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers. Let me hear her laughter, I would have her ever</p>

<p>Cool as dew in twilight, the lark above the flowers.</p>

<p>All the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose;</p>

<p>Up lanes, woods through, they troop in joyful bands. My sweet leads: she knows not why, but now she loiters,</p>

<p>Eyes the bent anemones, and hangs her hands. Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping,</p>

<p>Coming the rose: and unaware a cry Springs in her bosom for odours and for colour,</p>

<p>Covert and the nightingale; she knows not why.</p>

<p>Kerchief'd head and chin she darts between her tulips,</p>

<p>Streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain: Some bend beaten cheek to gravel, and their angel</p>

<p>She will be; she lifts them, and on she speeds again. Black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway:</p>

<p>She is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth. So when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder</p>

<p>Saw I once a white dove, sole light of earth.</p>

<p>Prim litde scholars are the flowers of her garden, Train'd to stand in rows, and asking if they please.</p>

<p>I might love them well but for loving more the wild ones: O my wild ones! they tell me more than these.</p>

<p>GEORGE MEREDITH</p>

<p>You, my wild one, you tell of honied field-rose,</p>

<p>Violet, blushing eglantine in life; and even as they,</p>

<p>They by the wayside are earnest of your goodness, You are of life's, on the banks that line the way.</p>

<p>Peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose,</p>

<p>Jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three. Parted is the window; she sleeps; the starry jasmine</p>

<p>Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me. Sweeter unpossess'd, have I said of her my sweetest ?</p>

<p>Not while she sleeps: while she sleeps the jasmine breathes, Luring her to love; she sleeps; the starry jasmine</p>

<p>Bears me to her pillow under white rose-wreaths.</p>

<p>Yellow with birdfoot-trefoil are the grass-glades;</p>

<p>Yellow with cinquefoil of the dew-gray leaf; Yellow with stonecrop; the moss-mounds are yellow;</p>

<p>Blue-neck'd the wheat sways, yellowing to the sheaf. Green-yellow, bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle;</p>

<p>Sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine: Earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens,</p>

<p>Thinking of the harvest: I look and think of mine.</p>

<p>This I may know: her dressing and undressing</p>

<p>Such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport Shift from cloud to moonlight; or edging over thunder</p>

<p>Slips a ray of sun; or sweeping into port White sails furl; or on the ocean borders</p>

<p>White sails lean along the waves leaping green. Visions of her shower before me, but from eyesight</p>

<p>Guarded she would be like the sun were she seen.</p>

<p>Front door and back of the moss'd old farmhouse</p>

<p>Open with the morn, and in a breezy link Freshly sparkles garden to stripe-shadow'd orchard,</p>

<p>Green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink. Busy in the grass the early sun of summer</p>

<p>Swarms, and the blackbird's mellow fluting notes Call my darling up with round and roguish challenge:</p>

<p>Quaintest, richest carol of all the singing throats!</p>

<p>1144 GEORGE MEREDITH</p>

<p>Cool was the woodside; cool as her white dairy</p>

<p>Keeping sweet the cream-pan; and there the boys from school, Cricketing below, rush'd brown and red with sunshine;</p>

<p>O the dark translucence of the deep-eyed cool! Spying from the farm, herself she fetch'd a pitcher</p>

<p>Full of milk, and tilted for each in turn the beak. Then a little fellow, mouth up and on tiptoe,</p>

<p>Said, 'I will kiss you': she laugh'd and lean'd her cheek.</p>

<p>Doves of the fir-wood walling high our red roof</p>

<p>Through the long noon coo, crooning through the coo. Loose droop the leaves, and down the sleepy roadway</p>

<p>Sometimes pipes a chaffinch; loose droops the blue. Cows flap a slow tail knee-deep in the river,</p>

<p>Breathless, given up to sun and gnat and fly. Nowhere is she seen; and if I see her nowhere,</p>

<p>Lightning may come, straight rains and tiger sky.</p>

<p>O the golden sheaf, the rustling treasure-armful!</p>

<p>O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced! O the treasure-tresses one another over</p>

<p>Nodding! O the girdle slack about the waist! Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet</p>

<p>Quick amid the wheat-ears: wound about the waist, Gather'd, see these brides of Earth one blush of ripeness!</p>

<p>O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!</p>

<p>Large and smoky red the sun's cold disk drops,</p>

<p>Clipp'd by naked hills, on violet shaded snow: Eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise,</p>

<p>Whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow. Nightlong on black print-branches our beech-tree</p>

<p>Gazes in this whiteness: nighdong could I. Here may life on death or death on life be painted.</p>

<p>Let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die!</p>

<p>Gossips count her faults; they scour a narrow chamber Where there is no window, read not heaven or her.</p>

<p>'When she was a tiny,' one aged woman quavers, Plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear.</p>

<p>GEORGE MEREDITH</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>Faults she had once as she learn'd to run and tumbled: Faults of feature some see, beauty not complete.</p>

<p>Yet, good gossips, beauty that makes holy</p>

<p>Earth and air, may have faults from head to feet.</p>

<p>Hither she comes; she comes to me; she lingers,</p>

<p>Deepens her brown eyebrows, while in new surprise High rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger;</p>

<p>Yet am I the light and living of her eyes. Something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming,</p>

<p>Nets her in her blushes, and wounds her, and tames. Sure of her haven, O like a dove alighting,</p>

<p>Arms up, she dropp'd: our souls were in our names.</p>

<p>Soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise.</p>

<p>Yellow oats and brown wheat, barley pale as rye, Long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher,</p>

<p>Felt the girdle loosen'd, seen the tresses fly. Soon will she lie like a blood-red sunset.</p>

<p>Swift with the to-morrow, green-wing'd Spring! Sing from the South-west, bring her back the truants,</p>

<p>Nightingale and swallow, song and dipping wing.</p>

<p>Soft new beech-leaves, up to beamy April</p>

<p>Spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain, you Lucid in the moon, raise lilies to the skyfields,</p>

<p>Youngest green transfused in silver shining through: Fairer than the lily, than the wild white cherry:</p>

<p>Fair as in image my seraph love appears Borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids:</p>

<p>Fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears.</p>

<p>Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,</p>

<p>I would speak my heart out: heaven is my need. Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood,</p>

<p>Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed. Flushing like the dogwood crimson in October;</p>

<p>Streaming like the flag-reed South-west blown; Flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted whitebeam:</p>

<p>All seem to know what is for heaven alone.</p>

<p>710 Barbara</p>

<p>On the Sabbath-day,</p>

<p>Through the churchyard old and grey,</p>

<p>Over the crisp and yellow leaves, I held my rustling way;</p>

<p>And amid the words of mercy, falling on my soul like balms;</p>

<p>'Mid the gorgeous storms of musicin the mellow organ-calms,</p>

<p>'Mid the upward streaming prayers, and the rich and solemn psalms,</p>

<p>I stood careless, Barbara.</p>

<p>My heart was otherwhere While the organ shook the air,</p>

<p>And the priest, with outspread hands, blessed the people with a prayer;</p>

<p>But, when rising to go homeward, with a mild and saint-like shine Gleamed a face of airy beauty with its heavenly eyes on mine Gleamed and vanished in a momentO that face was surely thine Out of heaven, Barbara!</p>

<p>O pallid, pallid face!</p>

<p>0 earnest eyes of grace!</p>

<p>When last I saw thee, dearest, it was in another place.</p>

<p>You came running forth to meet me with my love-gift on your wrist:</p>

<p>The flutter of a long white dress, then all was lost in mist</p>

<p>A purple stain of agony was on the mouth I kissed,</p>

<p>That wild morning, Barbara!</p>

<p>1 searched in my despair, Sunny noon and midnight air;</p>

<p>I could not drive away the thought that you were lingering there.</p>

<p>0 many and many a winter night I sat when you were gone, My worn face buried in my hands, beside the fire alone. Within the dripping churchyard, the rain plashing on your stone, You were sleeping, Barbara.</p>

<p>'Mong angels, do you think Of the precious golden link</p>

<p>1 clasped around your happy arm while sitting by yon brink?</p>

<p>CHARLES DICKENS 1147</p>

<p>Or when that night of gliding dance, of laughter and guitars, Was emptied of its music, and we watched, through latticed bars, The silent midnight heaven creeping o'er us with its stars, Till the day broke, Barbara?</p>

<p>In the years I've changed;</p>

<p>Wild and far my heart hath ranged,</p>

<p>And many sins and errors now have been on me avenged;</p>

<p>But to you I have been faithful, whatsoever good I lacked:</p>

<p>I loved you, and above my life still hangs that love intact</p>

<p>Your love the trembling rainbow, I the reckless cataract.</p>

<p>Still I love you, Barbara!</p>

<p>Yet, love, I am unblest; With many doubts oppressed,</p>

<p>I wander like a desert wind, without a place of rest.</p>

<p>Could I but win you for an hour from off that starry shore,</p>

<p>The hunger of my soul were stilled, for Death hath told you more</p>

<p>Than the melancholy world doth know; things deeper than all lore</p>

<p>Will you teach me, Barbara?</p>

<p>In vain, in vain, in vain, You will never come again.</p>

<p>There droops upon the dreary hills a mournful fringe of rain; The gloaming closes slowly round, loud winds are in the tree, Round selfish shores for ever moans the hurt and wounded sea, There is no rest upon the earth, peace is with Death and thee, Barbara!</p>

<p>711 The Ivy Green</p>

<p>Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,</p>

<p>That creepeth o'er ruins old!</p>

<p>Of right choice food are his meals I ween,</p>

<p>In his cell so lone and cold.</p>

<p>The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,</p>

<p>To pleasure his dainty whim:</p>

<p>THOMAS EDWARD BROWN</p>

<p>And the mouldering dust that years have made</p>

<p>Is a merry meal for him.</p>

<p>Creeping where no life is seen, A rare old plant is the Ivy green.</p>

<p>Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,</p>

<p>And a stanch old heart has he.</p>

<p>How closely he twineth, how tight he clings</p>

<p>To his friend the huge Oak Tree!</p>

<p>And slily he traileth along the ground,</p>

<p>And his leaves he gently waves,</p>

<p>As he joyously hugs and crawleth round</p>

<p>The rich mould of dead men's graves.</p>

<p>Creeping where grim death has been, A rare old plant is the Ivy green.</p>

<p>Whole ages have fled and their works decayed,</p>

<p>And nations have scattered been;</p>

<p>But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,</p>

<p>From its hale and hearty green.</p>

<p>The brave old plant in its lonely days,</p>

<p>Shall fatten upon the past:</p>

<p>For the stateliest building man can raise,</p>

<p>Is the Ivy's food at last.</p>

<p>Creeping on, where time has been, A rare old plant is the Ivy green.</p>

<p>Give a man a pipe he can smoke,</p>

<p>Give a man a book he can read: And his home is bright with a calm delight,</p>

<p>The Blessed Damozel</p>

<p>The blessed Damozel lean'd out</p>

<p>From the gold bar of Heaven: Her blue grave eyes were deeper much</p>

<p>Than a deep water, even. She had three lilies in her hand,</p>

<p>And the stars in her hair were seven.</p>

<p>Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,</p>

<p>No wrought flowers did adorn, But a white rose of Mary's gift</p>

<p>On the neck meetly worn; And her hair, lying down her back,</p>

<p>Was yellow like ripe corn.</p>

<p>Herseem'd she scarce had been a day One of God's choristers;</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>The wonder was not yet quite gone</p>

<p>From that still look of hers; Albeit, to them she left, her day</p>

<p>Had counted as ten years.</p>

<p>(To one it is ten years of years: . . . Yet now, here in this place,</p>

<p>Surely she lean'd o'er me,her hair Fell all about my face. . . .</p>

<p>Nothing: the Autumn-fall of leaves. The whole year sets apace.)</p>

<p>It was the terrace of God's house</p>

<p>That she was standing on, By God built over the sheer depth</p>

<p>In which Space is begun; So high, that looking downward thence,</p>

<p>She scarce could see the sun.</p>

<p>It lies from Heaven across the flood</p>

<p>Of ether, as a bridge. Beneath, the tides of day and night</p>

<p>With flame and darkness ridge The void, as low as where this earth</p>

<p>Spins like a fretful midge.</p>

<p>But in those tracts,with her, it was</p>

<p>The peace of utter light And silence. For no breeze may stir</p>

<p>Along the steady flight Of seraphim; no echo there,</p>

<p>Beyond all depth or height.</p>

<p>Heard hardly, some of her new friends,</p>

<p>Playing at holy games, Spake, gentle-mouth'd, among themselves,</p>

<p>Their virginal chaste names; And the souls, mounting up to God,</p>

<p>Went by her like thin flames.</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>And still she bow'd herself, and stoop'd</p>

<p>Into the vast waste calm; Till her bosom's pressure must have made</p>

<p>The bar she lean'd on warm, And the lilies lay as if asleep</p>

<p>Along her bended arm.</p>

<p>From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw</p>

<p>Time, like a pulse, shake fierce Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove,</p>

<p>In that steep gulf, to pierce The swarm; and then she spoke, as when</p>

<p>The stars sang in their spheres.</p>

<p>'I wish that he were come to me,</p>

<p>For he will come,' she said. 'Have I not pray'd in solemn Heaven?</p>

<p>On earth, has he not pray'd? Are not two prayers a perfect strength?</p>

<p>And shall I feel afraid?</p>

<p>'When round his head the aureole clings,</p>

<p>And he is clothed in white, I'll take his hand, and go with him</p>

<p>To the deep wells of light, And we will step down as to a stream</p>

<p>And bathe there in God's sight.</p>

<p>'We two will stand beside that shrine,</p>

<p>Occult, withheld, untrod, Whose lamps tremble continually</p>

<p>With prayer sent up to God; And where each need, reveal'd, expects</p>

<p>Its patient period.</p>

<p>'We two will lie i' the shadow of</p>

<p>That living mystic tree Within whose secret growth the Dove</p>

<p>Sometimes is felt to be, While every leaf that His plumes touch</p>

<p>Saith His name audibly.</p>

<p>'And I myself will teach to him,</p>

<p>I myself, lying so, The songs I sing here; which his mouth</p>

<p>Shall pause in, hush'd and slow, .Finding some knowledge at each pause,</p>

<p>And some new thing to know.'</p>

<p>(Alas! to her wise simple mind These things were all but known</p>

<p>Before: they trembled on her sense, Her voice had caught their tone.</p>

<p>Alas for lonely Heaven! Alas For life wrung out alone!</p>

<p>Alas, and though the end were reach'd ? . . .</p>

<p>Was thy part understood Or borne in trust? And for her sake</p>

<p>Shall this too be found good ? May the close lips that knew not prayer</p>

<p>Praise ever, though they would?)</p>

<p>'We two,' she said, 'will seek the groves</p>

<p>Where the lady Mary is, With her five handmaidens, whose names</p>

<p>Are five sweet symphonies: Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,</p>

<p>Margaret and Rosalys.</p>

<p>'Circle-wise sit they, with bound locks</p>

<p>And bosoms covered; Into the fine cloth, white like flame,</p>

<p>Weaving the golden thread, To fashion the birth-robes for them</p>

<p>Who are just born, being dead.</p>

<p>'He shall fear, haply, and be dumb.</p>

<p>Then I will lay my cheek To his, and tell about our love,</p>

<p>Not once abash'd or weak: And the dear Mother will approve</p>

<p>My pride, and let me speak.</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>'Herself shall bring us, hand in hand, To Him round whom all souls</p>

<p>Kneelthe unnumber'd solemn heads Bow'd with their aureoles:</p>

<p>And Angels, meeting us, shall sing To their citherns and citoles.</p>

<p>'There will I ask of Christ the Lord Thus much for him and me:</p>

<p>To have more blessing than on earth In nowise; but to be</p>

<p>As then we were,being as then At peace. Yea, verily.</p>

<p>'Yea, verily; when he is come</p>

<p>We will do thus and thus: Till this my vigil seem quite strange</p>

<p>And almost fabulous; We two will live at once, one life;</p>

<p>And peace shall be with us.'</p>

<p>She gazed, and listen'd, and then said, Less sad of speech than mild,</p>

<p>'All this is when he comes.' She ceased: The light thrill'd past her, fill'd</p>

<p>With Angels, in strong level lapse. Her eyes pray'd, and she smiled.</p>

<p>(I saw her smile.) But soon their flight Was vague 'mid the poised spheres.</p>

<p>And then she cast her arms along The golden barriers,</p>

<p>And laid her face between her hands, And wept. (I heard her tears.)</p>

<p>He framed a sweeter Song, More sweet than ever a poet's heart</p>

<p>Gave yet to the English tongue.</p>

<p>She was a lady of royal blood;</p>

<p>And when, past sorrow and teen, He stood where still through his crownless years</p>

<p>His Scottish realm had been, At Scone were the happy lovers crowned,</p>

<p>A heart-wed King and Queen.</p>

<p>But the bird may fall from the bough of youth,</p>

<p>And song be turned to moan, And Love's storm-cloud be the shadow of Hate, When the tempest-waves of a troubled State</p>

<p>Are beating against a throne.</p>

<p>Yet well they loved; and the god of Love,</p>

<p>Whom well the King had sung, Might find on the earth no truer hearts</p>

<p>His lowliest swains among.</p>

<p>From the days when first she rode abroad With Scottish maids in her train,</p>

<p>I Catherine Douglas won the trust Of my mistress, sweet Queen Jane.</p>

<p>And oft she sighed, "To be born a King!"</p>

<p>And oft along the way When she saw the homely lovers pass</p>

<p>She has said, "Alack the day!"</p>

<p>Years waned,the loving and toiling years:</p>

<p>Till England's wrong renewed Drove James, by outrage cast on his crown,</p>

<p>To the open field of feud.</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>'Twas when the King and his host were met</p>

<p>At the leaguer of Roxbro' hold, The Queen o' the sudden sought his camp</p>

<p>With a tale of dread to be told.</p>

<p>And she showed him a secret letter writ</p>

<p>That spoke of treasonous strife, And how a band of his noblest lords</p>

<p>Were sworn to take his life.</p>

<p>"And it may be here or it may be there, In the camp or the court," she said:</p>

<p>"But for my sake come to your people's arms And guard your royal head."</p>

<p>Quoth he, " 'Tis the fifteenth day of the siege,</p>

<p>And the castle's nigh to yield." "O face your foes on your throne," she cried,</p>

<p>"And show the power you wield; And under your Scottish people's love</p>

<p>You shall sit as under your shield."</p>

<p>At the fair Queen's side I stood that day When he bade them raise the siege,</p>

<p>And back to his Court he sped to know How the lords would meet their Liege.</p>

<p>But when he summoned his Parliament,</p>

<p>The louring brows hung round, Like clouds that circle the mountain-head</p>

<p>Ere the first low thunders sound.</p>

<p>For he had tamed the nobles' lust And curbed their power and pride,</p>

<p>And reached out an arm to right the poor Through Scotland far and wide;</p>

<p>And many a lordly wrong-doer By the headsman's axe had died.</p>

<p>'Twas then upspoke Sir Robert Graeme, The bold o'ermastering man:</p>

<p>dante gabriel rossetti 1157</p>

<p>"O King, in the name of your Three Estates I set you under their ban!</p>

<p>"For, as your lords made oath to you</p>

<p>Of service and fealty, Even in likewise you pledged your oath</p>

<p>Their faithful sire to be:</p>

<p>"Yet all we here that are nobly sprung</p>

<p>Have mourned dear kith and kin Since first for the Scottish Barons' curse</p>

<p>Did your bloody rule begin."</p>

<p>With that he laid his hands on his King:</p>

<p>"Is this not so, my lords?" But of all who had sworn to league with him</p>

<p>Not one spake back to his words.</p>

<p>Quoth the King:"Thou speak'st but for one Estate,</p>

<p>Nor doth it avow thy gage. Let my liege lords hale this traitor hence 1"</p>

<p>The Graeme fired dark with rage: "Who works for lesser men than himself,</p>

<p>He earns but a widess wage!"</p>

<p>But soon from the dungeon where he lay</p>

<p>He won by privy plots, And forth he fled with a price on his head</p>

<p>To the country of the Wild Scots.</p>

<p>And word there came from Sir Robert Graeme</p>

<p>To the King at Edinbro': "No Liege of mine thou art; but I see From this day forth alone in thee</p>

<p>God's creature, my mortal foe.</p>

<p>"Through thee are my wife and children lost,</p>

<p>My heritage and lands; And when my God shall show me a way, Thyself my mortal foe will I slay</p>

<p>With these my proper hands."</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>Against the coming of Christmastide</p>

<p>That year the King bade call I' the Black Friars' Charterhouse of Perth</p>

<p>A solemn festival.</p>

<p>And we of his household rode with him</p>

<p>In a close-ranked company; But not till the sun had sunk from his throne</p>

<p>Did we reach the Scottish Sea.</p>

<p>That eve was clenched for a boding storm, 'Neath a toilsome moon half seen;</p>

<p>The cloud stooped low and the surf rose high;</p>

<p>And where there was a line of the sky, Wild wings loomed dark between.</p>

<p>And on a rock of the black beach-side,</p>

<p>By the veiled moon dimly lit, There was something seemed to heave with life</p>

<p>As the King drew nigh to it.</p>

<p>And was it only the tossing furze</p>

<p>Or brake of the waste sea-wold ? Or was it an eagle bent to the blast? When near we came, we knew it at last</p>

<p>For a woman tattered and old.</p>

<p>But it seemed as though by a fire within</p>

<p>Her writhen limbs were wrung; And as soon as the King was close to her,</p>

<p>She stood up gaunt and strong.</p>

<p>'Twas then the moon sailed clear of the rack</p>

<p>On high in her hollow dome; And still as aloft with hoary crest</p>

<p>Each clamorous wave rang home, Like fire in snow the moonlight blazed</p>

<p>Amid the champing foam.</p>

<p>And the woman held his eyes with her eyes: "O King, thou art come at last;</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI 1159</p>

<p>But thy wraith has haunted the Scottish Sea To my sight for four years past.</p>

<p>"Four years it is since first I met,</p>

<p>'Twixt the Duchray and the Dhu, A shape whose feet clung close in a shroud,</p>

<p>And that shape for thine I knew.</p>

<p>"A year again, and on Inchkeith Isle</p>

<p>I saw thee pass in the breeze, With the cerecloth risen above thy feet</p>

<p>And wound about thy knees.</p>

<p>"And yet a year, in the Links of Forth,</p>

<p>As a wanderer without rest, Thou cam'st with both thine arms i' the shroud</p>

<p>That clung high up thy breast.</p>

<p>"And in this hour I find thee here,</p>

<p>And well mine eyes may note That the winding-sheet hath passed thy breast</p>

<p>And risen around thy throat.</p>

<p>"And when I meet thee again, O King,</p>

<p>That of death hast such sore drouth, Except thou turn again on this shore, The winding-sheet shall have moved once more</p>

<p>And covered thine eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>"O King, whom poor men bless for their King,</p>

<p>Of thy fate be not so fain; But these my words for God's message take, And turn thy steed, O King, for her sake</p>

<p>Who rides beside thy rein!"</p>

<p>While the woman spoke, the King's horse reared</p>

<p>As if it would breast the sea, And the Queen turned pale as she heard on the gale</p>

<p>The voice die dolorously.</p>

<p>Il6o DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>When the woman ceased, the steed was still,</p>

<p>But the King gazed on her yet, And in silence save for the wail of the sea</p>

<p>His eyes and her eyes met.</p>

<p>At last he said:"God's ways are His own;</p>

<p>Man is but shadow and dust. Last night I prayed by His altar-stone; To-night I wend to the feast of His Son;</p>

<p>And in Him I set my trust.</p>

<p>"I have held my people in sacred charge,</p>

<p>And have not feared the sting Of proud men's hate,to His will resign'd Who has but one same death for a hind</p>

<p>And one same death for a King.</p>

<p>"And if God in His wisdom have brought close</p>

<p>The day when I must die, That day by water or fire or air My feet shall fall in the destined snare</p>

<p>Wherever my road may lie.</p>

<p>"What man can say but the Fiend hath set</p>

<p>Thy sorcery on my path, My heart with the fear of death to fill, And turn me against God's very will</p>

<p>To sink in His burning wrath?"</p>

<p>The woman stood as the train rode past,</p>

<p>And moved nor limb nor eye; And when we were shipped, we saw her there</p>

<p>Still standing against the sky.</p>

<p>As the ship made way, the moon once more</p>

<p>Sank slow in her rising pall; And I thought of the shrouded wraith of the King,</p>

<p>And I said, "The Heavens know all."</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI Il6l</p>

<p>And now, ye lasses, must ye hear</p>

<p>How my name is Kate Barlass: But a little thing, when all the tale</p>

<p>Is told of the weary mass Of crime and woe which in Scotland's realm</p>

<p>God's will let come to pass.</p>

<p>'Twas in the Charterhouse of Perth</p>

<p>That the King and all his Court Were met, the Christmas Feast being done,</p>

<p>For solace and disport.</p>

<p>'Twas a wind-wild eve in February,</p>

<p>And against the casement-pane The branches smote like summoning hands</p>

<p>And muttered the driving rain.</p>

<p>And when the wind swooped over the lift</p>

<p>And made the whole heaven frown, It seemed a grip was laid on the walls</p>

<p>To tug the housetop down.</p>

<p>And the Queen was there, more stately fair</p>

<p>Than a lily in garden set; And the king was loth to stir from her side; For as on the day when she was his bride,</p>

<p>Even so he loved her yet.</p>

<p>And the Earl of Athole, the King's false friend,</p>

<p>Sat with him at the board; And Robert Stuart the chamberlain</p>

<p>Who had sold his sovereign Lord.</p>

<p>Yet the traitor Christopher Chaumber there</p>

<p>Would fain have told him all, And vainly four times that night he strove</p>

<p>To reach the King through the hall.</p>

<p>But the wine is bright at the goblet's brim Though the poison lurk beneath;</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>And the apples still are red on the tree Within whose shade may the adder be That shall turn thy life to death.</p>

<p>There was a knight of the King's fast friends</p>

<p>Whom he called the King of Love; And to such bright cheer and courtesy</p>

<p>That name might best behove.</p>

<p>And the King and Queen both loved him well</p>

<p>For his gentle knightliness; And with him the King, as that eve wore on,</p>

<p>Was playing at the chess.</p>

<p>And the King said, (for he thought to jest</p>

<p>And soothe the Queen thereby;) "In a book 'tis writ that this same year</p>

<p>A King shall in Scotland die.</p>

<p>"And I have pondered the matter o'er,</p>

<p>And this have I found, Sir Hugh, There are but two Kings on Scottish ground,</p>

<p>And those Kings are I and you.</p>

<p>"And I have a wife and a newborn heir,</p>

<p>And you are yourself alone; So stand you stark at my side with me</p>

<p>To guard our double throne.</p>

<p>"For here sit I and my wife and child,</p>

<p>As well your heart shall approve, In full surrender and soothfastness,</p>

<p>Beneath your Kingdom of Love."</p>

<p>And the Knight laughed, and the Queen too smiled;</p>

<p>But I knew her heavy thought, And I strove to find in the good King's jest</p>

<p>What cheer might thence be wrought.</p>

<p>1162</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>And I said, "My Liege, for the Queen's dear love</p>

<p>Now sing the song that of old You made, when a captive Prince you lay, And the nightingale sang sweet on the spray,</p>

<p>In Windsor's castle-hold."</p>

<p>Then he smiled the smile I knew so well When he thought to please the Queen;</p>

<p>The smile which under all bitter frowns Of hate that rose between,</p>

<p>For ever dwelt at the poet's heart Like the bird of love unseen.</p>

<p>And he kissed her hand and took his harp,</p>

<p>And the music sweedy rang; And when the song burst forth, it seemed</p>

<p>'Twas the nightingale that sang.</p>

<p>"Worship, ye lovers, on this May: Of bliss your \alends are begun:</p>

<p>Sing with us, Away, Winter, awayl</p>

<p>Come, Summer, the sweet season and sunt Awa\e for shame,your heaven is won,</p>

<p>And amorously your heads lift all:</p>

<p>Than\ Love, that you to his grace doth calll"</p>

<p>But when he bent to the Queen, and sang</p>

<p>The speech whose praise was hers It seemed his voice was the voice of the Spring</p>

<p>And the voice of the bygone years.</p>

<p>"The fairest and the freshest flower That ever I saw before that hour, The which o' the sudden made to start The blood of my body to my heart. **#####</p>

<p>Ah sweet, are ye a worldly creature Or heavenly thing in form of nature?"</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>And the song was long, and richly stored With wonder and beauteous things;</p>

<p>And the harp was tuned to every change Of minstrel ministerings;</p>

<p>But when he spoke of the Queen at the last, Its strings were his own heart-strings.</p>

<p>"Unworthy but only of her grace,</p>

<p>Upon Love's roct^ that's easy and sure,</p>

<p>In guerdon of all my love's space She too\ me her humble creature. Thus fell my blissful aventure</p>

<p>In youth of love that from day to day</p>

<p>Flowereth aye new, and further I say.</p>

<p>"To reckon all the circumstance</p>

<p>As it happed when lessen gan my sore,</p>

<p>Of my rancor and woful chance,</p>

<p>It were too long,/ have done therefor. And of this flower I say no more</p>

<p>But unto my help her heart hath tended</p>

<p>And even from death her man defended."</p>

<p>"Aye, even from death," to myself I said;</p>

<p>For I thought of the day when she Had borne him the news, at Roxbro' siege,</p>

<p>Of the fell confederacy.</p>

<p>But Death even then took aim as he sang</p>

<p>With an arrow deadly bright; And the grinning skull lurked grimly aloof, And the wings were spread far over the roof</p>

<p>More dark than the winter night.</p>

<p>Yet truly along the amorous song</p>

<p>Of Love's high pomp and state, There were words of Fortune's trackless doom</p>

<p>And the dreadful face of Fate.</p>

<p>And oft have I heard again in dreams The voice of dire appeal</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>In which the King then sang of the pit That is under Fortune's wheel.</p>

<p>"And under the wheel beheld I there An ugly Pit as deep as hell,</p>

<p>That to behold I quaked for fear: And this I heard, that who therein fell Came no more up, tidings to tell:</p>

<p>Whereat, astound of the fearful sight,</p>

<p>I wist not what to do for fright."</p>

<p>And oft has my thought called up again</p>

<p>These words of the changeful song: "Wist thou thy pain and thy travail To come, well might'st thou weep and wail!' And our wail, O God I is long.</p>

<p>But the song's end was all of his love;</p>

<p>And well his heart was grac'd With her smiling lips and her tear-bright eyes</p>

<p>As his arm went round her waist.</p>

<p>And on the swell of her long fair throat</p>

<p>Close clung the necklet-chain As he bent her pearl-tir'd head aside, And in the warmth of his love and pride</p>

<p>He kissed her lips full fain.</p>

<p>And her true face was a rosy red,</p>

<p>The very red of the rose That, couched on the happy garden-bed,</p>

<p>In the summer sunlight glows.</p>

<p>And all the wondrous things of love That sang so sweet through the song</p>

<p>Were in the look that met in their eyes, And the look was deep and long.</p>

<p>'Twas then a knock came at the outer gate, And the usher sought the King.</p>

<p>n66</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>"The woman you met by the Scottish Sea, My Liege, would tell you a thing;</p>

<p>And she says that her present need for speech Will bear no gainsaying."</p>

<p>And the King said:"The hour is late;</p>

<p>To-morrow will serve, I ween." Then he charged the usher strictly, and said:</p>

<p>"No word of this to the Queen."</p>

<p>But the usher came again to the King, "Shall I call her back?" quoth he:</p>

<p>"For as she went on her way, she cried, 'Woe! Woe! then the thing must be!' "</p>

<p>And the King paused, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>Then he called for the Voidee-cup; And as we heard the twelfth hour strike, There by true lips and false lips alike</p>

<p>Was the draught of trust drained up.</p>

<p>So with reverence meet to King and Queen,</p>

<p>To bed went all from the board; And the last to leave of the courtly train Was Robert Stuart the chamberlain Who had sold his sovereign lord.</p>

<p>And all the locks of the chamber-door</p>

<p>Had the traitor riven and brast; And that Fate might win sure way from afar, He had drawn out every bolt and bar</p>

<p>That made the entrance fast.</p>

<p>And now at midnight he stole his way</p>

<p>To the moat of the outer wall, And laid strong hurdles closely across</p>

<p>Where the traitors' tread should fall.</p>

<p>But we that were the Queen's bower-maids Alone were left behind;</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>1167</p>

<p>And with heed we drew the curtains close Against the winter wind.</p>

<p>And now that all was still through the hall,</p>

<p>More clearly we heard the rain That clamored ever against the glass</p>

<p>And the boughs that beat on the pane.</p>

<p>But the fire was bright in the ingle-nook,</p>

<p>And through empty space around The shadows cast on the arras'd wall 'Mid the pictured kings stood sudden and tall</p>

<p>Like spectres sprung from the ground.</p>

<p>And the bed was dight in a deep alcove;</p>

<p>And as he stood by the fire The king was still in talk with the Queen</p>

<p>While he doffed his goodly attire.</p>

<p>And the song had brought the image back</p>

<p>Of many a bygone year; And many a loving word they said With hand in hand and head laid to head;</p>

<p>And none of us went anear.</p>

<p>But Love was weeping outside the house,</p>

<p>A child in the piteous rain; And as he watched the arrow of Death, He wailed for his own shafts close in the sheath</p>

<p>That never should fly again.</p>

<p>And now beneath the window arose</p>

<p>A wild voice suddenly: And the King reared straight, but the Queen fell back</p>

<p>As for bitter dule to dree; And all of us knew the woman's voice</p>

<p>Who spoke by the Scottish Sea.</p>

<p>"O King," she cried, "in an evil hour They drove me from thy gate;</p>

<p>n68</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>And yet my voice must rise to thine ears; But alas! it comes too late!</p>

<p>"Last night at mid-watch, by Aberdour, When the moon was dead in the skies</p>

<p>O King, in a death-light of thine own I saw thy shape arise.</p>

<p>"And in full season, as erst I said, The doom had gained its growth;</p>

<p>And the shroud had risen above thy neck And covered thine eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>"And no moon woke, but the pale dawn broke,</p>

<p>And still thy soul stood there; And I thought its silence cried to my soul</p>

<p>As the first rays crowned its hair.</p>

<p>"Since then have I journeyed fast and fain</p>

<p>In very despite of Fate, Lest Hope might still be found in God's will:</p>

<p>But they drove me from thy gate.</p>

<p>"For every man on God's ground, O King, His death grows up from his birth</p>

<p>In a shadow-plant perpetually;</p>

<p>And thine towers high, a black yew-tree, O'er the Charterhouse of Perth!"</p>

<p>That room was built far out from the house;</p>

<p>And none but we in the room Might hear the voice that rose beneath,</p>

<p>Nor the tread of the coming doom.</p>

<p>For now there came a torchlight-glare,</p>

<p>And a clang of arms there came; And not a soul in that space but thought</p>

<p>Of the foe Sir Robert Graeme.</p>

<p>Yea, from the country of the Wild Scots, O'er mountain, valley, and glen,</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>He had brought with him in murderous league Three hundred armed men.</p>

<p>The King knew all in an instant's flash,</p>

<p>And like a King did he stand; But there was no armor in all the room</p>

<p>Nor weapon lay to his hand.</p>

<p>And all we women flew to the door And thought to have made it fast:</p>

<p>But the bolts were gone and the bars were gone And the locks were riven and brast.</p>

<p>And he caught the pale queen in his arms</p>

<p>As the iron footsteps fell, Then loosed her, standing alone, and said,</p>

<p>"Our bliss was our farewell!"</p>

<p>And 'twixt his lips he murmured a prayer,</p>

<p>And he crossed his brow and breast; And proudly in royal hardihood Even so with folded arms he stood, The prize of the bloody quest.</p>

<p>Then on me leaped the Queen like a deer:</p>

<p>"Catherine, help!" she cried. And low at his feet we clasped his knees</p>

<p>Together side by side. "Oh! even a King, for his people's sake,</p>

<p>From treasonous death must hide!"</p>

<p>"For her sake most!" I cried, and I marked The pang that my words would wring.</p>

<p>And the iron tongs from the chimney-nook I snatched and held to the King:</p>

<p>"Wrench up the plank! and the vault beneath Shall yield safe harboring."</p>

<p>With brows low-bent, from my eager hand The heavy heft did he take;</p>

<p>1170 DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>And the plank at his feet he wrenched and tore: And as he frowned through the open floor, Again I said, "For her sake!"</p>

<p>Then he cried to the Queen, "God's will be done!"</p>

<p>For her hands were clasped in prayer. And down he sprang to the inner crypt; And straight we closed the plank he had ripp'd</p>

<p>And toiled to smoothe it fair.</p>

<p>(Alas! in that vault a gap once was</p>

<p>Wherethro' the King might have fled; But three days since close-walled had it been By his will; for the ball would roll therein When without at the palm he play'd.)</p>

<p>Then the Queen cried, "Catherine, keep the door,</p>

<p>And I to this will suffice!" At her word I rose all dazed to my feet,</p>

<p>And my heart was fire and ice.</p>

<p>And louder ever the voices grew, And the tramp of men in mail; Until to my brain it seemed to be As though I tossed on a ship at sea In the teeth of a crashing gale.</p>

<p>Then back I flew to the rest; and hard</p>

<p>We strove with sinews knit To force the table against the door;</p>

<p>But we might not compass it.</p>

<p>Then my wild gaze sped far down the hall To the place of the hearthstone-sill;</p>

<p>And the Queen bent ever above the floor, For the plank was rising still.</p>

<p>And now the rush was heard on the stair, And "God, what help?" was our cry.</p>

<p>And was I frenzied or was I bold ?</p>

<p>I looked at each empty stanchion-hold, And no bar but my arm had I!</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>II7I</p>

<p>Like iron felt my arm, as through</p>

<p>The staple I made it pass: Alack! it was flesh and boneno more! 'Twas Catherine Douglas sprang to the door,</p>

<p>But I fell back Kate Barlass.</p>

<p>With that they all thronged into the hall,</p>

<p>Half dim to my failing ken; And the space that was but a void before</p>

<p>Was a crowd of wrathful men. Behind the door I had fall'n and lay,</p>

<p>Yet my sense was wildly aware, And for all the pain of my shattered arm</p>

<p>I never fainted there.</p>

<p>Even as I fell, my eyes were cast</p>

<p>Where the King leaped down to the pit;</p>

<p>And lo! the plank was smooth in its place, And the Queen stood far from it.</p>

<p>And under the litters and through the bed</p>

<p>And within the presses all The traitors sought for the King, and pierced</p>

<p>The arras around the wall.</p>

<p>And through the chamber they ramped and stormed</p>

<p>Like lions loose in the lair, And scarce could trust to their very eyes,</p>

<p>For behold! no King was there.</p>

<p>Then one of them seized the Queen, and cried,</p>

<p>"Now tell us, where is thy lord?" And he held the sharp point over her heart: She dropped not her eyes nor did she start,</p>

<p>But she answered never a word.</p>

<p>Then the sword half pierced the true true breast:</p>

<p>But it was the Graeme's own son Cried, "This is a woman,we seek a man!"</p>

<p>And away from her girdle-zone He struck the point of the murderous steel;</p>

<p>And that foul deed was not done.</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>And forth flowed all the throng like a sea,</p>

<p>And 'twas empty space once more; And my eyes sought out the wounded Queen</p>

<p>As I lay behind the door.</p>

<p>And I said: "Dear Lady, leave me here,</p>

<p>For I cannot help you now; But fly while you may, and none shall reck</p>

<p>Of my place here lying low."</p>

<p>And she said, "My Catherine, God help thee!"</p>

<p>Then she looked to the distant floor, And clasping her hands, "Oh God help him,"</p>

<p>She sobbed, "for we can no more!"</p>

<p>But God He knows what help may mean,</p>

<p>If it mean to live or to die; And what sore sorrow and mighty moan On earth it may cost ere yet a throne</p>

<p>Be filled in His house on high.</p>

<p>And now the ladies fled with the Queen:</p>

<p>And through the open door The night-wind wailed round the empty room</p>

<p>And the rushes shook on the floor.</p>

<p>And the bed drooped low in the dark recess</p>

<p>Whence the arras was rent away; And the firelight still shone over the space</p>

<p>Where our hidden secret lay.</p>

<p>And the rain had ceased, and the moonbeams lit</p>

<p>The window high in the wall, Bright beams that on the plank that I knew</p>

<p>Through the painted pane did fall And gleamed with the splendor of Scotland's crown</p>

<p>And shield armorial.</p>

<p>But then a great wind swept up the skies, And the climbing moon fell back;</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>"73</p>

<p>And the royal blazon fled from the floor,</p>

<p>And nought remained on its track; And high in the darkened window-pane</p>

<p>The shield and the crown were black.</p>

<p>And what I say next I partly saw</p>

<p>And partly I heard in sooth, And partly since from the murderers' lips</p>

<p>The torture wrung the truth.</p>

<p>For now again came the armed tread</p>

<p>And fast through the hall it fell; But the throng was less; and ere I saw,</p>

<p>By the voice without I could tell That Robert Stuart had come with them</p>

<p>Who knew that chamber well.</p>

<p>And over the space the Graeme strode dark</p>

<p>With his mantle round him flung; And in his eye was a flaming light</p>

<p>But not a word on his tongue.</p>

<p>And Stuart held a torch to the floor,</p>

<p>And he found the thing he sought; And they slashed the plank away with their swords;</p>

<p>And O God! I fainted not!</p>

<p>And the traitor held his torch in the gap,</p>

<p>All smoking and smouldering; And through the vapor and fire, beneath</p>

<p>In the dark crypt's narrow ring, With a shout that pealed to the room's high roof</p>

<p>They saw their naked King.</p>

<p>Half naked he stood, but stood as one</p>

<p>Who yet could do and dare; With the crown, the King was stript away, The Knight was reft of his battle-array,</p>

<p>But still the Man was there.</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>From the rout then stepped a villain forth,</p>

<p>Sir John Hall was his name; With a knife unsheathed he leapt to the vault</p>

<p>Beneath the torchlight-flame.</p>

<p>Of his person and stature was the King</p>

<p>A man right manly strong, And mightily by the shoulder-blades</p>

<p>His foe to his feet he flung.</p>

<p>Then the traitor's brother, Sir Thomas Hall,</p>

<p>Sprang down to work his worst; And the King caught the second man by the neck</p>

<p>And flung him above the first.</p>

<p>And he smote and trampled them under him;</p>

<p>And a long month thence they bare All black their throats with the grip of his hands</p>

<p>When the hangman's hand came there.</p>

<p>And sore he strove to have had their knives, But the sharp blades gashed his hands.</p>

<p>Oh James! so armed, thou hadst battled there Till help had come of thy bands;</p>

<p>And oh! once more thou hadst held our throne And ruled thy Scottish lands!</p>

<p>But while the King o'er his foes still raged With a heart that nought could tame,</p>

<p>Another man sprang down to the crypt;</p>

<p>And with his sword in his hand hard-gripp'd There stood Sir Robert Graeme.</p>

<p>(Now shame on the recreant traitor's heart</p>

<p>Who durst not face his King Till the body unarmed was wearied out</p>

<p>With two-fold combating!</p>

<p>Ah! well might the people sing and say, As oft ye have heard aright:</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>1175</p>

<p>"0 Robert Grceme, 0 Robert Grxme, Who slew our King, God give thee shame!" For he slew him not as a knight.)</p>

<p>And the naked King turned round at bay, But his strength had passed the goal,</p>

<p>And he could but gasp:"Mine hour is come;</p>

<p>But oh! to succor thine own soul's doom, Let a priest now shrive my soul!"</p>

<p>And the traitor looked on the King's spent strength, And said:"Have I kept my word?</p>

<p>Yea, King, the mortal pledge that I gave?</p>

<p>No black friar's shrift thy soul shall save, But the shrift of this red sword!"</p>

<p>With that he smote his King through the breast;</p>

<p>And all they three in that pen Fell on him and stabbed and stabbed him there</p>

<p>Like merciless murderous men.</p>

<p>Yet seemed it now that Sir Robert Graeme, Ere the King's last breath was o'er, , Turned sick at heart with the deadly sight And would have done no more.</p>

<p>But a cry came from the troop above:</p>

<p>"If him thou do not slay, The price of his life that thou dost spare</p>

<p>Thy forfeit life shall pay!"</p>

<p>O God! what more did I hear or see,</p>

<p>Or how should I tell the rest? But there at length our King lay slain</p>

<p>With sixteen wounds in his breast.</p>

<p>O God! and now did a bell boom forth, And the murderers turned and fled; Too late, too late, O God, did it sound! And I heard the true men mustering round, And the cries and the coming tread.</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>But ere they came to the black death-gap</p>

<p>Somewise did I creep and steal; And lo! or ever I swooned away, Through the dusk I saw where the white face lay</p>

<p>In the Pit of Fortune's Wheel.</p>

<p>And now, ye Scottish maids who have heard Dread things of the days grown old,</p>

<p>Even at the last, of true Queen Jane May somewhat yet be told,</p>

<p>And how she dealt for her dear lord's sake Dire vengeance manifold.</p>

<p>'Twas in the Charterhouse of Perth,</p>

<p>In the fair-lit Death-chapelle, That the slain King's corpse on bier was lain</p>

<p>With chant and requiem-knell.</p>

<p>And all with royal wealth of balm</p>

<p>Was the body purified: And none could trace on the brow and lips</p>

<p>The death that he had died.</p>

<p>In his robes of state he lay asleep</p>

<p>With orb and sceptre in hand; And by the crown he wore on his throne</p>

<p>Was his kingly forehead spann'd.</p>

<p>And, girls, 'twas a sweet sad thing to see</p>

<p>How the curling golden hair, As in the day of the poet's youth,</p>

<p>From the King's crown clustered there.</p>

<p>And if all had come to pass in the brain</p>

<p>That throbbed beneath those curls, Then Scots had said in the days to come That this their soil was a different home</p>

<p>And a different Scotland, girls!</p>

<p>And the Queen sat by him night and day, And oft she knelt in prayer,</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI 1177</p>

<p>All wan and pale in the widow's veil That shrouded her shining hair.</p>

<p>And I had got good help of my hurt:</p>

<p>And only to me some sign She made; and save the priests that were there</p>

<p>No face would she see but mine.</p>

<p>And the month of March wore on apace; And now fresh couriers fared Still from the country of the Wild Scots With news of the traitors snared.</p>

<p>And still as I told her day by day,</p>

<p>Her pallor changed to sight, And the frost grew to a furnace-flame</p>

<p>That burnt her visage white.</p>

<p>And evermore as I brought her word,</p>

<p>She bent to her dead King James, And in the cold ear with fire-drawn breath</p>

<p>She spoke the traitors' names.</p>

<p>But when the name of Sir Robert Graeme</p>

<p>Was the one she had to give, I ran to hold her up from the floor; For the froth was on her lips, and sore</p>

<p>I feared that she could not live.</p>

<p>And the month of March wore nigh to its end,</p>

<p>And still was the death-pall spread; For she would not bury her slaughtered lord</p>

<p>Till his slayers all were dead.</p>

<p>And now of their dooms dread tidings came,</p>

<p>And of torments fierce and dire; And nought she spake,she had ceased to speak,</p>

<p>But her eyes were a soul on fire.</p>

<p>But when I told her the bitter end Of the stern and just award,</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>She leaned o'er the bier, and thrice three times She kissed the lips of her lord.</p>

<p>And then she said,"My King, they are dead!"</p>

<p>And she knelt on the chapel-floor, And whispered low with a strange proud smile,</p>

<p>"James, James, they suffered more!"</p>

<p>Last she stood up to her queenly height,</p>

<p>But she shook like an autumn leaf, As though the fire wherein she burned Then left her body, and all were turned</p>

<p>To winter of life-long grief.</p>

<p>And "O James!" she said,"My James!" she said,</p>

<p>"Alas for the woful thing, That a poet true and a friend of man, In desperate days of bale and ban,</p>

<p>Should needs be born a King!"</p>

<p>lovesight</p>

<p>When do I see thee most, beloved one?</p>

<p>When in the light the spirits of mine eyes</p>

<p>Before thy face, their altar, solemnize</p>

<p>The worship of that Love through thee made known?</p>

<p>Or when in the dusk hours, (we two alone,)</p>

<p>Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies</p>

<p>Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies,</p>

<p>And my soul only sees thy soul its own?</p>

<p>O love, my love! if I no more should see</p>

<p>Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee,</p>

<p>Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,</p>

<p>How then should sound upon Life's darkening slope</p>

<p>The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,</p>

<p>The wind of Death's imperishable wing?</p>

<p>Heart's Hope</p>

<p>By what word's power, the key of paths untrod, Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore, Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore</p>

<p>DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Even as that sea which Israel crossed dryshod?</p>

<p>For lo! in some poor rhythmic period,</p>

<p>Lady, I fain would tell how evermore</p>

<p>Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor</p>

<p>Thee from myself, neither our love from God.</p>

<p>Yea, in God's name, and Love's, and thine, would I</p>

<p>Draw from one loving heart such evidence</p>

<p>As to all hearts all things shall signify;</p>

<p>Tender as dawn's first hill-fire, and intense</p>

<p>As instantaneous penetrating sense,</p>

<p>In Spring's birth-hour, of other Springs gone by.</p>

<p>Genius in Beauty</p>

<p>Beauty like hers is genius. Not the call</p>

<p>Of Homer's or of Dante's heart sublime,</p>

<p>Not Michael's hand furrowing the zones of time,</p>

<p>Is more with compassed mysteries musical;</p>

<p>Nay, not in Spring's or Summer's sweet footfall</p>

<p>More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeathes</p>

<p>Than doth this sovereign face, whose love-spell breathes</p>

<p>Even from its shadowed contour on the wall.</p>

<p>As many men are poets in their youth,</p>

<p>But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong</p>

<p>Even through all change the indomitable song;</p>

<p>So in like wise the envenomed years, whose tooth</p>

<p>Rends shallower grace with ruin void of ruth,</p>

<p>Upon this beauty's power shall wreak no wrong.</p>

<p>Silent Noon</p>

<p>Your hands lie open in the long, fresh grass, The finger-points look through like rosy blooms: Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms 'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass. All round our nest, far as the eye can pass, Are golden kingcup-fields with silver edge Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn hedge. 'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass. Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky,</p>

<p>Il8o DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</p>

<p>So this wing'd hour is dropped to us from above. Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower, This close-companioned inarticulate hour When twofold silence was the song of love.</p>

<p>720 Love-Sweetness</p>

<p>Sweet dimness of her loosened hair's downfall About thy face; her sweet hands round thy head In gracious fostering union garlanded; Her tremulous smiles; her glances' sweet recall Of love; her murmuring sighs memorial; Her mouth's culled sweetness by thy kisses shed On cheeks and neck and eyelids, and so led Back to her mouth, which answers there for all: What sweeter than these things, except the thing In lacking which all these would lose their sweet: The confident heart's still fervor: the swift beat And soft subsidence of the spirit's wing, Then when it feels, in cloud-girt wayfaring, The breath of kindred plumes against its feet?</p>

<p>72/ Heart's Compass</p>

<p>Sometimes thou seem'st not as thyself alone, But as the meaning of all things that are; A breathless wonder, shadowing forth afar Some heavenly solstice hushed and halcyon; Whose unstirred lips are music's visible tone; Whose eyes the sun-gate of the soul unbar, Being of its furthest fires oracular The evident heart of all life sown and mown. Even such love is; and is not thy name Love? Yea, by thy hand the Love-god rends apart All gathering clouds of Night's ambiguous art; Flings them far down, and sets thine eyes above; And simply, as some gage of flower or glove, Stakes with a smile the world against thy heart.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA GEORGINA ROSSETTI</p>

<p>Il8l</p>

<p>722 Her Gifts</p>

<p>High grace, the dower of queens; and therewithal</p>

<p>Some wood-born wonder's sweet simplicity;</p>

<p>A glance like water brimming with the sky</p>

<p>Or hyacinth-light where forest-shadows fall;</p>

<p>Such thrilling pallor of cheek as doth enthral</p>

<p>The heart; a mouth whose passionate forms imply</p>

<p>All music and all silence held thereby;</p>

<p>Deep golden locks, her sovereign coronal;</p>

<p>A round reared neck, meet column of Love's shrine</p>

<p>To cling to when the heart takes sanctuary;</p>

<p>Hands which for ever at Love's bidding be,</p>

<p>And soft-stirred feet still answering to his sign:</p>

<p>These are her gifts, as tongue may tell them o'er.</p>

<p>Breathe low her name, my soul; for that means more.</p>

<p>[1830-18941</p>

<p>723 Song</p>

<p>When I am dead, my dearest,</p>

<p>Sing no sad songs for me; Plant thou no roses at my head,</p>

<p>Nor shady cypress tree: Be the green grass above me</p>

<p>With showers and dewdrops wet; And if thou wilt, remember,</p>

<p>And if thou wilt, forget.</p>

<p>I shall not see the shadows,</p>

<p>I shall not feel the rain; I shall not hear the nightingale</p>

<p>Sing on, as if in pain; And dreaming through the twilight</p>

<p>That doth not rise nor set, Haply I may remember,</p>

<p>And haply may forget.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA GEORGINA ROSSETTI</p>

<p>Remember</p>

<p>Remember me when I am gone away, Gone far away into the silent land; When you can no more hold me by the hand,</p>

<p>Nor I half turn to go, yet turning stay.</p>

<p>Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you plann'd: Only remember me; you understand</p>

<p>It will be late to counsel then or pray.</p>

<p>Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieve: For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,</p>

<p>Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad.</p>

<p>725 Up-Hill</p>

<p>Does the road wind up-hill all the way?</p>

<p>Yes, to the very end. Will the day's journey take the whole long day?</p>

<p>From morn to night, my friend.</p>

<p>But is there for the night a resting-place?</p>

<p>A roof for when the slow dark hours begin. May not the darkness hide it from my face?</p>

<p>You cannot miss that inn.</p>

<p>Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?</p>

<p>Those who have gone before. Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?</p>

<p>They will not keep you standing at that door.</p>

<p>Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak ?</p>

<p>Of labour you shall find the sum. Will there be beds for me and all who seek?</p>

<p>Yea, beds for all who come.</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>In the Round Tower at Jhansi June 8, 18%] (Indian Mutiny)</p>

<p>A hundred, a thousand to one; even so;</p>

<p>Not a hope in the world remained: The swarming howling wretches below</p>

<p>Gained and gained and gained.</p>

<p>Skene looked at his pale young wife.</p>

<p>'Is the time come?''The time is come.' Young, strong, and so full of life,</p>

<p>The agony struck them dumb.</p>

<p>Close his arm about her now,</p>

<p>Close her cheek to his, Close the pistol to her brow</p>

<p>God forgive them this I</p>

<p>'Will it hurt much?' 'No, mine own: I wish I could bear the pang for both.'</p>

<p>'I wish I could bear the pang alone: Courage, dear, I am not loth.'</p>

<p>Kiss and kiss: 'It is not pain</p>

<p>Thus to kiss and die. One kiss more.''And yet one again.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye.''Good-bye.'</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>[1834-1896]</p>

<p>The Defence of Guenevere</p>

<p>But, knowing now that they would have her speak, She threw her wet hair backward from her brow, Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,</p>

<p>As though she had had there a shameful blow, And feeling it shameful to feel aught but shame All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>She must a little touch it; like one lame</p>

<p>She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head</p>

<p>Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame</p>

<p>The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:</p>

<p>"O knights and lords, it seems but little skill</p>

<p>To talk of well-known things past now and dead.</p>

<p>"God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,</p>

<p>And pray you all forgiveness heartily!</p>

<p>Because you must be right, such great lords; still</p>

<p>"Listen, suppose your time were come to die, And you were quite alone and very weak; Yea, laid a dying while very mightily</p>

<p>"The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak Of river through your broad lands running well: Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:</p>

<p>" 'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell, Now choose one cloth for ever; which they be, I will not tell you, you must somehow tell</p>

<p>" 'Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!' Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes, At foot of your familiar bed to see</p>

<p>"A great God's angel standing, with such dyes, Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands, Held out two ways, light from the inner skies</p>

<p>"Showing him well, and making his commands Seem to be God's commands, moreover, too, Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;</p>

<p>"And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue, Wavy and long, and one cut short and red; No man could tell the better of the two.</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>"After a shivering half-hour you said:</p>

<p>'God help! heaven's color, the blue;' and he said, 'hell.'</p>

<p>Perhaps you would then roll upon your bed,</p>

<p>"And cry to all good men that loved you well, 'Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;' Launcelot went away, then I could tell,</p>

<p>"Like wisest man how all things would be, moan, And roll and hurt myself, and long to die, And yet fear much to die for what was sown.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie, Whatever may have happened through these years, God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie."</p>

<p>Her voice was low at first, being full of tears, But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill, Growing a windy shriek in all men's ears,</p>

<p>A ringing in their startled brains, until</p>

<p>She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,</p>

<p>And her great eyes began again to fill,</p>

<p>Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk, But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair! Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,</p>

<p>She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair, Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame, With passionate twisting of her body there:</p>

<p>"It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came To dwell at Arthur's court: at Christmastime This happened; when the heralds sung his name,</p>

<p>"Son of King Ban of Benwick, seemed to chime Along with all the bells that rang that day, O'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.</p>

<p>1186 WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>"Christmas and whitened winter passed away, And over me the April sunshine came, Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea</p>

<p>"And in the Summer I grew white with flame, And bowed my head down: Autumn, and the sick Sure knowledge things would never be the same,</p>

<p>"However often Spring might be most thick Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,</p>

<p>"To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through My eager body; while I laughed out loud, And let my lips curl up at false or true,</p>

<p>"Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud. Behold, my judges, then the cloths were brought; While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd</p>

<p>"Belonging to the time ere I was bought By Arthur's great name and his little love; Must I give up for ever then, I thought,</p>

<p>"That which I deemed would ever round me move, Glorifying all things; for a little word, Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove</p>

<p>"Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord Will that all folks should be quite happy and good ? I love God now a little, if this cord</p>

<p>"Were broken, once for all what striving could Make me love anything in earth or heaven? So day by day it grew, as if one should</p>

<p>"Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,</p>

<p>Down to a cool sea on a summer day;</p>

<p>Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>"Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,</p>

<p>Until one surely reached the sea at last,</p>

<p>And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay</p>

<p>"Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips, Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,</p>

<p>"In the lone sea, far off from any ships! Do I not know now of a day in Spring? No minute of that wild day ever slips</p>

<p>"From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing, And wheresoever I may be, straightway Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:</p>

<p>"I was half mad with beauty on that day,</p>

<p>And went without my ladies all alone,</p>

<p>In a quiet garden walled round every way;</p>

<p>"I was right joyful of that wall of stone,</p>

<p>That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,</p>

<p>And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,</p>

<p>"Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy With wary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad; Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,</p>

<p>"A little thing just then had made me mad; I dared not think, as I was wont to do, Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had</p>

<p>"Held out my long hand up against the blue, And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers, Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,</p>

<p>"There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers Round by the edges; what should I have done, If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,</p>

<p>1188 WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>"And startling green drawn upward by the sun? But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair, And trancedly stood watching the west wind run</p>

<p>"With faintest half-heard breathing sound: why there I lose my head e'en now in doing this; But shortly listen: In that garden fair</p>

<p>"Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day, I scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,</p>

<p>"When both our mouths went wandering in one way, And aching sorely, met among the leaves; Our hands being left behind strained far away.</p>

<p>"Never within a yard of my bright sleeves Had Launcelot come before: and now so nigh! After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie, Whatever happened on through all those years, God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.</p>

<p>"Being such a lady could I weep these tears If this were true ? A great queen such as I Having sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;</p>

<p>"And afterwards she liveth hatefully, Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps: Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly,</p>

<p>"Do I not see how God's dear pity creeps</p>

<p>All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?</p>

<p>Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,</p>

<p>"Buried in some place far down in the south Men are forgetting as I speak to you; By her head sever'd in that awful drouth</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>"Of pity that drew Agravaine's fell blow, I pray your pity! let me not scream out For ever after, when the shrill winds blow</p>

<p>"Through half your casde-locks! let me not shout For ever after in the winter night When you ride out alone! in battle-rout</p>

<p>"Let not my rusting tears make your sword light! Ah! God of mercy, how he turns away! So, ever must I dress me to the fight,</p>

<p>"So: let God's justice work! Gauwaine, I say, See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,</p>

<p>"One bitter day in la Fausse Garde, for so</p>

<p>All good knights held it after, saw:</p>

<p>Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though</p>

<p>"You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw.</p>

<p>Not so, fair lords, even if the world should end</p>

<p>"This very day, and you were judges here Instead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear</p>

<p>"Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance, His side sink in? as my knight cried and said: 'Slayer of unarm'd men, here is a chance!</p>

<p>" 'Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head, By God I am so glad to fight with you, Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead</p>

<p>" 'For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do, For all my wounds are moving in my breast, And I am getting mad with waiting so.'</p>

<p>1190 WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>"He struck his hands together o'er the beast, Who fell down flat, and grovell'd at his feet, And groan'd at being slain so young: 'At least,'</p>

<p>"My knight said, 'Rise you, sir, who are so fleet At catching ladies, half-arm'd will I fight, My left side all uncovered!' then I weet,</p>

<p>"Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight Upon his knave's face; not until just then Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight</p>

<p>"Along the lists look to my stake and pen With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh From agony beneath my waist-chain, when</p>

<p>"The fight began, and to me they drew nigh; Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right, And traversed warily, and ever high</p>

<p>"And fast leapt caitiff's sword, until my knight Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand, Caught it and swung it; that was all the fight;</p>

<p>"Except a spout of blood on the hot land,</p>

<p>For it was hottest summer; and I know</p>

<p>I wonder'd how the fire, while I should stand,</p>

<p>"And burn, against the heat, would quiver so, Yards above my head; thus these matters went, Which things were only warnings of the woe</p>

<p>"That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent, For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord; Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent</p>

<p>"With all his wickedness; say no rash word Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes Wept all away to gray, may bring some sword</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>"To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand; And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,</p>

<p>"Yea also at my full heart's strong command, See through my long throat how the words go up In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand</p>

<p>"The shadow lies like wine within a cup Of marvellously color'd gold; yea now This litde wind is rising, look you up,</p>

<p>"And wonder how the light is falling so Within my moving tresses: will you dare When you have looked a little on my brow,</p>

<p>"To say this thing is vile? or will you care For any plausible lies of cunning woof, Where you can see my face with no lie there</p>

<p>"For ever? am I not a gracious proof? 'But in your chamber Launcelot was found' Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,</p>

<p>"When a queen says with gentle queenly sound: 'O true as steel, come now and talk with me, I love to see your step upon the ground</p>

<p>" 'Unwavering, also well I love to see That gracious smile light up your face, and hear Your wonderful words, that all mean verily</p>

<p>" 'The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear</p>

<p>To me in everything, come here to-night,</p>

<p>Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;</p>

<p>" 'If you come not, I fear this time I might Get thinking over much of times gone by, When I was young, and green hope was in sight:</p>

<p>II9I</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>" 'For no man cares now to know why I sigh; And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs, Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie</p>

<p>" 'So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs</p>

<p>To see you, Launcelot; that we may be</p>

<p>Like children, once again, free from all wrongs</p>

<p>" 'Just for one night.' Did he not come to me ? What thing could keep true Launcelot away If I said, 'Come?' there was one less than three</p>

<p>"In my quiet room that night, and we were gay; Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick, Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea</p>

<p>"I looked at Launcelot's face and could not speak, For he looked helpless too, for a little while; Then I remember how I tried to shriek,</p>

<p>"And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile The stones they threw up rattled o'er my head And made me dizzier; till within a while</p>

<p>"My maids were all about me, and my head On Launcelot's breast was being soothed away From its white chattering, until Launcelot said: . . .</p>

<p>"By God! I will not tell you more to-day, Judge any way you will: what matters it? You know quite well the story of that fray,</p>

<p>"How Launcelot still'd their bawling, the mad fit</p>

<p>That caught up Gauwaine, all, all, verily,</p>

<p>But just that which would save me; these things flit.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie, Whatever may have happen'd these long years, God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS 1193</p>

<p>"All I have said is truth, by Christ's dear tears." She would not speak another word, but stood Turn'd sideways; listening, like a man who hears</p>

<p>His brother's trumpet sounding through the wood</p>

<p>Of his foes' lances. She leaned eagerly,</p>

<p>And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could</p>

<p>At last hear something really; joyfully</p>

<p>Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed</p>

<p>Of the roan charger drew all men to see,</p>

<p>The knight who came was Launcelot at good need.</p>

<p>728 Prologue of the Earthly Paradise</p>

<p>Of Heaven or Hell I have no power to sing, I cannot ease the burden of your fears, Or make quick-coming death a little thing, Or bring again the pleasure of past years, Nor for my words shall ye forget your tears, Or hope again for aught that I can say, The idle singer of an empty day.</p>

<p>But rather, when aweary of your mirth,</p>

<p>From full hearts still unsatisfied ye sigh,</p>

<p>And, feeling kindly unto all the earth,</p>

<p>Grudge every minute as it passes by,</p>

<p>Made the more mindful that the sweet days die</p>

<p>Remember me a little then I pray,</p>

<p>The idle singer of an empty day.</p>

<p>The heavy trouble, the bewildering care</p>

<p>That weighs us down who live and earn our bread,</p>

<p>These idle verses have no power to bear;</p>

<p>So let me sing of names remembered,</p>

<p>Because they, living not, can ne'er be dead,</p>

<p>Or long time take their memory quite away</p>

<p>From us poor singers of an empty day.</p>

<p>Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time, Why should I strive to set the crooked straight?</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>1194</p>

<p>Let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme Beats with light wing against the ivory gate, Telling a tale not too importunate To those who in the sleepy region stay, Lulled by the singer of an empty day.</p>

<p>Folk say, a wizard to a northern king At Christmas-tide such wondrous things did show, That through one window men beheld the spring, And through another saw the summer glow, And through a third the fruited vines a-row, While still, unheard, but in its wonted way, Piped the drear wind of that December day.</p>

<p>So with this Earthly Paradise it is, If ye will read aright, and pardon me, Who strive to build a shadowy isle of bliss Midmost the beating of the steely sea, Where tossed about all hearts of men must be; Whose ravening monsters mighty men shall slay, Not the poor singer of an empty day.</p>

<p>729 The Nymph's Song to Hylas</p>

<p>I know a little garden-close Set thick with lily and red rose, Where I would wander if I might From dewy dawn to dewy night, And have one with me wandering.</p>

<p>And though within it no birds sing, And though no pillar'd house is there, And though the apple boughs are bare Of fruit and blossom, would to God, Her feet upon the green grass trod, And I beheld them as before!</p>

<p>There comes a murmur from the shore, And in the place two fair streams are, Drawn from the purple hills afar, Drawn down unto the resdess sea;</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>1195</p>

<p>The hills whose flowers ne'er fed the bee, The shore no ship has ever seen, Still beaten by the billows green, Whose murmur comes unceasingly Unto the place for which I cry. For which I cry both day and night, For which I let slip all delight, That maketh me both deaf and blind, Careless to win, unskill'd to find, And quick to lose what all men seek.</p>

<p>Yet tottering as I am, and weak, Still have I left a little breath To seek within the jaws of death An entrance to that happy place; To seek the unforgotten face Once seen, once kiss'd, once reft from me Anigh the murmuring of the sea.</p>

<p>7jo The Day is Coming</p>

<p>Come hither, lads, and harken, for a tale there is to tell, Of the wonderful days a-coming, when all shall be better than well.</p>

<p>And the tale shall be told of a country, a land in the midst of the sea, And folk shall call it England in the days that are going to be.</p>

<p>There more than one in a thousand in the days that are yet to come, Shall have some hope of the morrow, some joy of the ancient home.</p>

<p>For then, laugh not, but listen to this strange tale of mine, All folk that are in England shall be better lodged than swine.</p>

<p>Then a man shall work and bethink him, and rejoice in the deeds of his hand,</p>

<p>Nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to stand.</p>

<p>Men in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear For to-morrow's lack of earning and the hunger-wolf anear.</p>

<p>1196 WILLIAM MORRIS</p>

<p>I tell you this for a wonder, that no man then shall be glad Of his fellow's fall and mishap to snatch at the work he had.</p>

<p>For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed, Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed.</p>

<p>O strange new wonderful justice! But for whom shall we gather the gain?</p>

<p>For ourselves and for each of our fellows, and no hand shall labor in vain.</p>

<p>Then all Mine and all Thine shall be Ours, and no more shall any man crave</p>

<p>For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave.</p>

<p>And what wealth then shall be left us when none shall gather gold To buy his friend in the market, and pinch and pine the sold?</p>

<p>Nay, what save the lovely city, and the little house on the hill,</p>

<p>And the wastes and the woodland beauty, and the happy fields we till;</p>

<p>And the homes of ancient stories, the tombs of the mighty dead; And the wise men seeking out marvels, and the poet's teeming head;</p>

<p>And the painter's hand of wonder; and the marvelous fiddle-bow, And the banded choirs of music: all those that do and know.</p>

<p>For all these shall be ours and all men's; nor shall any lack a share</p>

<p>Of the toil and the gain of living in the days when the world grows fair.</p>

<p>Ah! such are the days that shall be! But what are the deeds of to-day, In the days of the years we dwell in, that wear our lives away?</p>

<p>Why, then, and for what are we waiting?  There are three words to speak;</p>

<p>We will it, and what is the foeman but the dream-strong wakened and</p>

<p>weak ?</p>

<p>O why and for what are we waiting? while our brothers droop and die, And on every wind of the heavens a wasted life goes by.</p>

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS 1197</p>

<p>How long shall they reproach us where crowd on crowd they dwell, Poor ghosts of the wicked city, the gold-crushed, hungry hell ?</p>

<p>Through squalid life they labored, in sordid grief they died, Those sons of a mighty mother, those props of England's pride.</p>

<p>They are gone; there is none can undo it, nor save our souls from the curse;</p>

<p>But many a million cometh, and shall they be better or worse?</p>

<p>It is we must answer and hasten, and open wide the door</p>

<p>For the rich man's hurrying terror, and the slow-foot hope of the poor.</p>

<p>Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched, and their unlearned discontent, We must give it voice and wisdom till the waiting-tide be spent.</p>

<p>Come, then, since all things call us, the living and the dead, And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed.</p>

<p>Come, then, let us cast off fooling, and put by ease and rest, For the Cause alone is worthy till the good days bring the best.</p>

<p>Come, join in the only battle wherein no man can fail, Where whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still prevail.</p>

<p>Ah! come, cast off all fooling, for this, at least, we know:</p>

<p>That the Dawn and the Day is coming, and forth the Banners go.</p>

<p>73j The Days That Were</p>

<p>Whiles in the early winter eve We pass amid the gathering night Some homestead that we had to leave Years past; and see its candles bright Shine in the room beside the door Where we were merry years agone, But now must never enter more, As still the dark road drives us on. E'en so the world of men may turn At even of some hurried day</p>

<p>ARTHUR W. E. o'sHAUGHNESSY</p>

<p>And see the ancient glimmer burn Across the waste that hath no way; Then, with that faint light in its eyes, Awhile I bid it linger near And nurse in waving memories The bitter sweet of days that were.</p>

<p>JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY [1844-1800]</p>

<p>A White Rose</p>

<p>The red rose whispers of passion, And the white rose breathes of love;</p>

<p>O, the red rose is a falcon, And the white rose is a dove.</p>

<p>But I send you a cream-white rosebud</p>

<p>With a flush on its petal tips; For the love that is purest and sweetest</p>

<p>Has a kiss of desire on the lips.</p>

<p>ARTHUR WILLIAM EDGAR O'SHAUGHNESSY</p>

<p>[1844-1881]</p>

<p>Ode</p>

<p>We are the music-makers,</p>

<p>And we are the dreamers of dreams, Wandering by lone sea-breakers,</p>

<p>And sitting by desolate streams; World-losers and world-forsakers,</p>

<p>On whom the pale moon gleams: Yet we are the movers and shakers</p>

<p>Of the world for ever, it seems.</p>

<p>With wonderful deathless ditties</p>

<p>And out of a fabulous story We build up the world's great cities,</p>

<p>We fashion an empire's glory:</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE 1199</p>

<p>One man with a dream, at pleasure, Shall go forth and conquer a crown;</p>

<p>And three with a new song's measure Can trample an empire down.</p>

<p>We, in the ages lying</p>

<p>In the buried past of the earth, Built Nineveh with our sighing,</p>

<p>And Babel itself with our mirth; And o'erthrew them with prophesying</p>

<p>To the old of the new world's worth; For each age is a dream that is dying,</p>

<p>Or one that is coming to birth.</p>

<p>ROBERT WILLIAMS BUCHANAN</p>

<p>[1841-11)01]</p>

<p>734 Llz</p>

<p>The crimson light of sunset falls</p>

<p>Through the grey glamour of the murmuring rain, And creeping o'er the housetops crawls</p>

<p>Through the black smoke upon the broken pane, Steals to the straw on which she lies,</p>

<p>And tints her thin black hair and hollow cheeks, Her sun-tanned neck, her glistening eyes,</p>

<p>While faintly, sadly, fitfully she speaks. But when it is no longer light,</p>

<p>The pale girl smiles, with only One to mark, And dies upon the breast of Night,</p>

<p>Like trodden snowdrift melting in the dark.</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>[1837-1909]</p>

<p>735 Chorus from 'Atalanta'</p>

<p>When the hounds of spring are on winter's traces, The mother of months in meadow or plain</p>

<p>Fills the shadows and windy places With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain;</p>

<p>1200</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>And the brown bright nightingale amorous Is half assuaged for Itylus, For the Thracian ships and the foreign faces, The tongueless vigil, and all the pain.</p>

<p>Come with bows bent and with emptying of quivers,</p>

<p>Maiden most perfect, lady of light, With a noise of winds and many rivers,</p>

<p>With a clamour of waters, and with might; Bind on thy sandals, O thou most fleet, Over the splendour and speed of thy feet; For the faint east quickens, the wan west shivers,</p>

<p>Round the feet of the day and the feet of the night.</p>

<p>Where shall we find her, how shall we sing to her, Fold our hands round her knees, and cling?</p>

<p>O that man's heart were as fire and could spring to her, Fire, or the strength of the streams that spring!</p>

<p>For the stars and the winds are unto her</p>

<p>As raiment, as songs of the harp-player;</p>

<p>For the risen stars and the fallen cling to her, And the southwest-wind and the west-wind sing.</p>

<p>For winter's rains and ruins are over,</p>

<p>And all the season of snows and sins; The days dividing lover and lover,</p>

<p>The light that loses, the night that wins; And time remember'd is grief forgotten, And frosts are slain and flowers begotten, And in green underwood and cover</p>

<p>Blossom by blossom the spring begins.</p>

<p>The full streams feed on flower of rushes, Ripe grasses trammel a travelling foot,</p>

<p>The faint fresh flame of the young year flushes From leaf to flower and flower to fruit;</p>

<p>And fruit and leaf are as gold and fire,</p>

<p>And the oat is heard above the lyre,</p>

<p>And the hoofed heel of a satyr crushes The chestnut-husk at the chestnut-root.</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>And Pan by noon and Bacchus by night, Fleeter of foot than the fleet-foot kid, Follows with dancing and fills with delight</p>

<p>The Maenad and the Bassarid; And soft as lips that laugh and hide The laughing leaves of the trees divide, And screen from seeing and leave in sight The god pursuing, the maiden hid.</p>

<p>The ivy falls with the Bacchanal's hair</p>

<p>Over her eyebrows hiding her eyes; The wild vine slipping down leaves bare</p>

<p>Her bright breast shortening into sighs; The wild vine slips with the weight of its leaves, But the berried ivy catches and cleaves To the limbs that glitter, the feet that scare</p>

<p>The wolf that follows, the fawn that flies.</p>

<p>Itylus</p>

<p>Swallow, my sister, O sister swallow, How can thine heart be full of the spring? A thousand summers are over and dead. What hast thou found in the spring to follow? What hast thou found in thine heart to sing? What wilt thou do when the summer is shed?</p>

<p>O swallow, sister, O fair swift swallow,</p>

<p>Why wilt thou fly after spring to the south, The soft south whither thine heart is set? Shall not the grief of the old time follow?</p>

<p>Shall not the song thereof cleave to thy mouth? Hast thou forgotten ere I forget?</p>

<p>Sister, my sister, O fleet sweet swallow, Thy way is long to the sun and the south; But I, fulfill'd of my heart's desire, Shedding my song upon height, upon hollow, From tawny body and sweet small mouth Feed the heart of the night with fire.</p>

<p>1202 ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>I the nightingale all spring through,</p>

<p>0 swallow, sister, O changing swallow,</p>

<p>All spring through till the spring be done, Clothed with the light of the night on the dew, Sing, while the hours and the wild birds follow, Take flight and follow and find the sun.</p>

<p>Sister, my sister, O soft light swallow,</p>

<p>Though all things feast in the spring's guest-chamber, How hast thou heart to be glad thereof yet? For where thou fliest I shall not follow, Till life forget and death remember, Till thou remember and I forget.</p>

<p>Swallow, my sister, O singing swallow,</p>

<p>1 know not how thou hast heart to sing. Hast thou the heart? is it all past over?</p>

<p>Thy lord the summer is good to follow, And fair the feet of thy lover the spring:</p>

<p>But what wilt thou say to the spring thy lover?</p>

<p>O swallow, sister, O fleeting swallow, My heart in me is a molten ember</p>

<p>And over my head the waves have met. But thou wouldst tarry or I would follow Could I forget or thou remember, Couldst thou remember and I forget.</p>

<p>O sweet stray sister, O shifting swallow,</p>

<p>The heart's division divideth us.</p>

<p>Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree; But mine goes forth among sea-gulfs hollow</p>

<p>To the place of the slaying of Itylus,</p>

<p>The feast of Daulis, the Thracian sea.</p>

<p>O swallow, sister, O rapid swallow, I pray thee sing not a little space.</p>

<p>Are not the roofs and the lintels wet? The woven web that was plain to follow, The small slain body, the flower-like face, Can I remember if thou forget?</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE 1203</p>

<p>O sister, sister, thy first-begotten! The hands that cling and the feet that follow, The voice of the child's blood crying yet, Who hath remember'd me? who hath forgotten? Thou hast forgotten, O summer swallow, But the world shall end when I forget.</p>

<p>7J7 The Garden of Proserpine</p>

<p>Here, where the world is quiet,</p>

<p>Here, where all trouble seems Dead winds' and spent waves' riot</p>

<p>In doubtful dreams of dreams; I watch the green field growing For reaping folk and sowing, For harvest time and mowing,</p>

<p>A sleepy world of streams.</p>

<p>I am tired of tears and laughter, And men that laugh and weep</p>

<p>Of what may come hereafter For men that sow to reap:</p>

<p>I am weary of days and hours,</p>

<p>Blown buds of barren flowers,</p>

<p>Desires and dreams and powers And everything but sleep.</p>

<p>Here life has death for neighbor,</p>

<p>And far from eye or ear Wan waves and wet winds labor,</p>

<p>Weak ships and spirits steer; They drive adrift, and whither They wot not who make thither; But no such winds blow hither,</p>

<p>And no such things grow here.</p>

<p>No growth of moor or coppice,</p>

<p>No heather-flower or vine, But bloomless buds of poppies,</p>

<p>Green grapes of Proserpine,</p>

<p>1204 ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>Pale beds of blowing rushes Where no leaf blooms or blushes, Save this whereout she crushes For dead men deadly wine.</p>

<p>Pale, without name or number,</p>

<p>In fruitless fields of corn, They bow themselves and slumber</p>

<p>All night till light is born; And like a soul belated, In hell and heaven unmated, By cloud and mist abated Comes out of darkness morn.</p>

<p>Though one were strong as seven, He too with death shall dwell,</p>

<p>Nor wake with wings in heaven, Nor weep for pains in hell;</p>

<p>Though one were fair as roses,</p>

<p>His beauty clouds and closes;</p>

<p>And well though love reposes, In the end it is not well.</p>

<p>Pale, beyond porch and portal,</p>

<p>Crowned with calm leaves, she stands Who gathers all things mortal With cold immortal hands; Her languid lips are sweeter Than love's who fears to greet her To men that mix and meet her From many times and lands.</p>

<p>She waits for each and other, She waits for all men born; Forgets the earth her mother, The life of fruits and corn; And spring and seed and swallow Take wing for her and follow Where summer song rings hollow And flowers are put to scorn.</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE 1205</p>

<p>There go the loves that wither,</p>

<p>The old loves with wearier wings; And all dead years draw thither,</p>

<p>And all disastrous things; Dead dreams of days forsaken Blind buds that snows have shaken, Wild leaves that winds have taken, Red strays of ruined springs.</p>

<p>We are not sure of sorrow,</p>

<p>And joy was never sure; To-day will die to-morrow</p>

<p>Time stoops to no man's lure; And love, grown faint and fretful With lips but half regretful Sighs, and with eyes forgetful</p>

<p>Weeps that no loves endure.</p>

<p>From too much love of living,</p>

<p>From hope and fear set free, We thank with brief thanksgiving</p>

<p>Whatever gods may be That no life lives for ever; That dead men rise up never; That even the weariest river</p>

<p>Winds somewhere safe to sea.</p>

<p>Then star nor sun shall waken,</p>

<p>Nor any change of light: Nor sound of waters shaken,</p>

<p>Nor any sound or sight: Nor wintry leaves nor vernal, Nor days nor things diurnal; Only the sleep eternal</p>

<p>In an eternal night.</p>

<p>73$ A Match</p>

<p>If love were what the rose is,</p>

<p>And I were like the leaf, Our lives would grow together</p>

<p>1206</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>In sad or singing weather, Blown fields or flowerful closes,</p>

<p>Green pleasure or gray grief; If love were what the rose is,</p>

<p>And I were like the leaf.</p>

<p>If I were what the words are,</p>

<p>And love were like the tune, With double sound and single Delight our lips would mingle, With kisses glad as birds are</p>

<p>That get sweet rain at noon; If I were what the words are And love were like the tune.</p>

<p>If you were life, my darling,</p>

<p>And I your love were death, We'd shine and snow together Ere March made sweet the weather With daffodil and starling</p>

<p>And hours of fruitful breath; If you were life, my darling, And I your love were death.</p>

<p>If you were thrall to sorrow,</p>

<p>And I were page to joy, We'd play for lives and seasons With loving looks and treasons And tears of night and morrow</p>

<p>And laughs of maid and boy; If you were thrall to sorrow,</p>

<p>And I were page to joy.</p>

<p>If you were April's lady,</p>

<p>And I were lord in May, We'd throw with leaves for hours And draw for days with flowers, Till day like night were shady</p>

<p>And night were bright like day; If you were April's lady, And I were lord in May.</p>

<p>ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE 1207</p>

<p>If you were queen of pleasure,</p>

<p>And I were king of pain, We'd hunt down love together, Pluck out his flying-feather, And teach his feet a measure,</p>

<p>And find his mouth a rein; If you were queen of pleasure.</p>

<p>And I were king of pain.</p>

<p>759 A Forsaken Garden</p>

<p>In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,</p>

<p>At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee, Walled round with rocks as an inland island,</p>

<p>The ghost of a garden fronts the sea. A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses</p>

<p>The steep square slope of the blossomless bed Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses</p>

<p>Now lie dead.</p>

<p>The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,</p>

<p>To the low last edge of the long lone land. If a step should sound or a word be spoken,</p>

<p>Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand? So long have the gray bare walks lain guestless,</p>

<p>Through branches and briars if a man make way, He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, resdess</p>

<p>Night and day.</p>

<p>The dense hard passage is blind and stifled</p>

<p>That crawls by a track none turn to climb To the strait waste place that the years have rifled</p>

<p>Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time. The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;</p>

<p>The rocks are left when he wastes the plain; The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,</p>

<p>These remain.</p>

<p>Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;</p>

<p>As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry; From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,</p>

<p>Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.</p>

<p>I208 ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</p>

<p>Over the meadows that blossom and wither,</p>

<p>Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song. Only the sun and the rain come hither</p>

<p>All year long.</p>

<p>The sun burns sear, and the rain dishevels</p>

<p>One gaunt bleak, blossom of scentless breath. Only the wind here hovers and revels</p>

<p>In a round where life seems barren as death. Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,</p>

<p>Haply, of lovers none ever will know, Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping</p>

<p>Years ago.</p>

<p>Heart handfast in heart as they stood, "Look thither,"</p>

<p>Did he whisper? "Look forth from the flowers to the sea; For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,</p>

<p>And men that love lightly may dieBut we?" And the same wind sang, and the same waves whitened,</p>

<p>And or ever the garden's last petals were shed, In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,</p>

<p>Love was dead.</p>

<p>Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?</p>

<p>And were one to the endbut what end who knows? Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,</p>

<p>As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose. Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?</p>

<p>What love was ever as deep as a grave? They are loveless now as the grass above them</p>

<p>Or the wave.</p>

<p>All are at one now, roses and lovers,</p>

<p>Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea. Not a breath of the time that has been hovers</p>

<p>In the air now soft with a summer to be. Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter</p>

<p>Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, When, as they that are free now of weeping and laughter,</p>

<p>We shall sleep.</p>

<p>740 Margarita Sorori</p>

<p>A late lark twitters from the quiet skies: And from the west,</p>

<p>Where the sun, his day's work ended, Lingers as in content, There falls on the old, gray city An influence luminous and serene, A shining peace.</p>

<p>The smoke ascends</p>

<p>In a rosy-and-golden haze. The spires Shine, and are changed. In the valley Shadows rise. The lark sings on. The sun, Closing his benediction, Sinks, and the darkening air Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night Night with her train of stars And her great gift of sleep.</p>

<p>Here death may deal not again forever;</p>

<p>Here change may come not till all change end. From the graves they have made they shall rise up never;</p>

<p>Who have left naught living to ravage and rend. Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,</p>

<p>When the sun and the rain live, these shall be; Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing</p>

<p>Roll the sea.</p>

<p>Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,</p>

<p>Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink, Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble</p>

<p>The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink, Here now in his triumph where all things falter,</p>

<p>Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,</p>

<p>Death lies dead.</p>

<p>WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY</p>

<p>So be my passing!</p>

<p>My task accomplished and the long day done,</p>

<p>My wages taken, and in my heart</p>

<p>Some late lark singing,</p>

<p>Let me be gathered to the quiet west,</p>

<p>The sundown splendid and serene,</p>

<p>Death.</p>

<p>Invictus</p>

<p>Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole,</p>

<p>I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.</p>

<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud.</p>

<p>Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade,</p>

<p>And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</p>

<p>It matters not how strait the gate,</p>

<p>How charged with punishments the scroll,</p>

<p>I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul.</p>

<p>England, My England</p>

<p>What have I done for you, England, my England?</p>

<p>What is there I would not do, England, my own?</p>

<p>To the Song on your bugles blown, England</p>

<p>Down the years on your bugles blown?</p>

<p>Ever the faith endures,</p>

<p>England, my England: 'Take and break us: we are yours,</p>

<p>England, my own! Life is good, and joy runs high Between English earth and sky: Death is death; but we shall die</p>

<p>To the Song of your bugles blown, England</p>

<p>To the stars on your bugles blown!'</p>

<p>They call you proud and hard,</p>

<p>England, my England: You with worlds to watch and ward,</p>

<p>England, my own! You whose mail'd hand keeps the keys Of such teeming destinies, You could know nor dread nor ease</p>

<p>Were the Song on your bugles blown, England</p>

<p>Round the Pit on your bugles blown!</p>

<p>Mother of Ships whose might,</p>

<p>[1850-1894]</p>

<p>In the Highlands</p>

<p>In the highlands, in the country places, Where the old plain men have rosy faces, And the young fair maidens Quiet eyes; Where essential silence chills and blesses, And for ever in the hill-recesses Her more lovely music Broods and dies</p>

<p>O to mount again where erst I haunted; Where the old red hills are bird-enchanted, And the low green meadows Bright with sward; And when even dies, the million-tinted, And the night has come, and planets glinted, Lo, the valley hollow Lamp-bestarr'dl</p>

<p>O to dream, O to awake and wander There, and with delight to take and render, Through the trance of silence, Quiet breath! Lo! for there, among the flowers and grasses, Only the mightier movement sounds and passe: Only winds and rivers, Life and death.</p>

<p>If I have faltered more or less In my great task of happiness; If I have moved among my race</p>

<p>william cullen bryant</p>

<p>And shown no glorious morning face; If beams from happy human eyes Have moved me not; if morning skies, Books, and my food, and summer rain Knocked on my sullen heart in vain: Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take And stab my spirit broad awake; Or, Lord, if too obdurate I, Choose thou, before that spirit die, A piercing pain, a killing sin, And to my dead heart run them in.</p>

<p>74$ Requiem</p>

<p>Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die,</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT [1794-1878]</p>

<p>746 Thanatopsis</p>

<p>To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language; for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty, and she glides Into his darker musings, with a mild And healing sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;</p>

<p>1214 WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>Go forth, under the open sky, and list</p>

<p>To Nature's teachings, while from all around</p>

<p>Earth and her waters, and the depths of air</p>

<p>Comes a still voiceYet a few days, and thee</p>

<p>The all-beholding sun shall see no more</p>

<p>In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,</p>

<p>Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,</p>

<p>Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist</p>

<p>Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim</p>

<p>Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,</p>

<p>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up</p>

<p>Thine individual being, shalt thou go</p>

<p>To mix forever with the elements,</p>

<p>To be a brother to the insensible rock</p>

<p>And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain</p>

<p>Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak</p>

<p>Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.</p>

<p>Yet not to thine eternal resting-place Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant worldwith kings, The powerful of the earththe wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,the vales Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woodsrivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green; and, poured round all Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste, Are but the solemn decorations all Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, Are shining on the sad abodes of death, Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes That slumber in its bosom.Take the wings Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness, Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>Save his own dashingsyet the dead are there:</p>

<p>And millions in those solitudes, since first</p>

<p>The flight of years began, have laid them down</p>

<p>In their last sleepthe dead reign there alone.</p>

<p>So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw</p>

<p>In silence from the living, and no friend</p>

<p>Take note of thy departure? All that breathe</p>

<p>Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh</p>

<p>When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care</p>

<p>Plod on, and each one as before will chase</p>

<p>His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave</p>

<p>Their mirth and their employments, and shall come</p>

<p>And make their bed with thee. As the long train</p>

<p>Of ages glide away, the sons of men,</p>

<p>The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes</p>

<p>In the full strength of years, matron and maid,</p>

<p>The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man</p>

<p>Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,</p>

<p>By those, who in their turn shall follow them.</p>

<p>So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan, which moves To that mysterious realm, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>Robert of Lincoln</p>

<p>Merrily swinging on brier and weed, Near to the nest of his little dame, Over the mountain-side or mead, Robert of Lincoln is telling his name: Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; Snug and safe is that nest of ours, Hidden among the summer flowers. Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>Robert of Lincoln is gayly drest,</p>

<p>Wearing a bright black wedding-coat; White are his shoulders and white his crest. Hear him call in his merry note: Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; Look, what a nice new coat is mine, Sure there was never a bird so fine. Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,</p>

<p>Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings, Passing at home a patient life, Broods in the grass while her husband sings: Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; Brood, kind creature; you need not fear Thieves and robbers while I am here. Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>Modest and shy as a nun is she;</p>

<p>One weak chirp is her only note. Braggart and prince of braggarts is he, Pouring boasts from his little throat; Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; Never was I afraid of man; Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can! Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>Six white eggs on a bed of hay,</p>

<p>Flecked with purple, a pretty sight! There as the mother sits all day,</p>

<p>Robert is singing with all his might: Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; Nice good wife, that never goes out, Keeping house while I frolic about.</p>

<p>Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>Soon as the little ones chip the shell,</p>

<p>Six wide mouths are open for food; Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well, Gathering seeds for the hungry brood. Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; This new life is likely to be Hard for a gay young fellow like me. Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>Robert of Lincoln at length is made</p>

<p>Sober with work, and silent with care; Off is his holiday garment laid, Half forgotten that merry air: Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; Nobody knows but my mate and I Where our nest and our nestlings lie. Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>Summer wanes; the children are grown;</p>

<p>Fun and frolic no more he knows; Robert of Lincoln's a humdrum crone; Off he flies, and we sing as he goes: Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, Spink, spank, spink; When you can pipe that merry old strain, Robert of Lincoln, come back again. Chee, chee, chee.</p>

<p>Song of Marion's Men</p>

<p>Our band is few but true and tried,</p>

<p>Our leader frank and bold; The British soldier trembles</p>

<p>When Marion's name is told. Our fortress is the good greenwood,</p>

<p>Our tent the cypress-tree; We know the forest round us,</p>

<p>As seamen know the sea.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>We know its walls of thorny vines,</p>

<p>Its glades of reedy grass, Its safe and silent islands</p>

<p>Within the dark morass.</p>

<p>Woe to the English soldiery</p>

<p>That little dread us near! On them shall light at midnight</p>

<p>A strange and sudden fear: When, waking to their tents on fire,</p>

<p>They grasp their arms in vain, And they who stand to face us</p>

<p>Are beat to earth again; And they who fly in terror deem</p>

<p>A mighty host behind, And hear the tramp of thousands</p>

<p>Upon the hollow wind.</p>

<p>Then sweet the hour that brings release</p>

<p>From danger and from toil: We talk the battle over,</p>

<p>And share the battle's spoil. The woodland rings with laugh and shout,</p>

<p>As if a hunt were up, And woodland flowers are gathered</p>

<p>To crown the soldier's cup. With merry songs we mock the wind</p>

<p>That in the pine-top grieves, And slumber long and sweetly</p>

<p>On beds of oaken leaves.</p>

<p>Well knows the fair and friendly moon</p>

<p>The band that Marion leads The glitter of their rifles,</p>

<p>The scampering of their steeds. 'Tis life to guide the fiery barb</p>

<p>Across the moonlight plain; 'Tis life to feel the night-wind</p>

<p>That lifts the tossing mane.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>A moment in the British camp</p>

<p>A momentand away Back to the pathless forest,</p>

<p>Before the peep of day.</p>

<p>Grave men there are by broad Santee,</p>

<p>Grave men with hoary hairs; Their hearts are all with Marion,</p>

<p>For Marion are their prayers. And lovely ladies greet our band</p>

<p>With kindliest welcoming, With smiles like those of summer,</p>

<p>And tears like those of spring. For them we wear these trusty arms,</p>

<p>And lay them down no more Till we have driven the Briton,</p>

<p>Forever, from our shore.</p>

<p>749 JUNE</p>

<p>I gazed upon the glorious sky</p>

<p>And the green mountains round,</p>

<p>And thought that when I came to lie At rest within the ground,  'Twere pleasant, that in flowery June,</p>

<p>When brooks send up a cheerful tune, And groves a joyous sound,</p>

<p>The sexton's hand, my grave to make,</p>

<p>The rich, green mountain-turf should break.</p>

<p>A cell within the frozen mould, A coffin borne through sleet,</p>

<p>And icy clods above it rolled,</p>

<p>While fierce the tempests beat</p>

<p>Away!I will not think of these</p>

<p>Blue be the sky and soft the breeze, Earth green beneath the feet,</p>

<p>And be the damp mould gently pressed</p>

<p>Into my narrow place of rest.</p>

<p>1220</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>There through the long, long summer hours,</p>

<p>The golden light should lie, And thick young herbs and groups of flowers</p>

<p>Stand in their beauty by. The oriole should build and tell His love-tale close beside iny cell;</p>

<p>The idle butterfly Should rest him there, and there be heard The housewife bee and humming-bird.</p>

<p>And what if cheerful shouts at noon</p>

<p>Come, from the village sent, Or songs of maids, beneath the moon</p>

<p>With fairy laughter blent? And what if, in the evening light, Betrothed lovers walk in sight</p>

<p>Of my low monument? I would the lovely scene around Might know no sadder sight nor sound.</p>

<p>I know that I no more should see</p>

<p>The season's glorious show, Nor would its brightness shine for me,</p>

<p>Nor its wild music flow; But if, around my place of sleep, The friends I love should come to weep,</p>

<p>They might not haste to go. Soft airs, and song, and light, and bloom Should keep them lingering by my tomb.</p>

<p>These to their softened hearts should bear The thought of what has been,</p>

<p>And speak of one who cannot share The gladness of the scene;</p>

<p>Whose part, in all the pomp that fills</p>

<p>The circuit of the summer hills, Is that his grave is green;</p>

<p>And deeply would their hearts rejoice</p>

<p>To hear again his living voice.</p>

<p>The Past</p>

<p>Thou unrelenting Past! Strong are the barriers round thy dark domain,</p>

<p>And fetters, sure and fast, Hold all that enter thy unbreathing reign.</p>

<p>Far in thy realm withdrawn, Old empires sit in sullenness and gioom,</p>

<p>And glorious ages gone Lie deep within the shadow of thy womb.</p>

<p>Childhood, with all its mirth, Youth, Manhood, Age that draws us to the ground,</p>

<p>And last, Man's Life on earth, Glide to thy dim dominions, and are bound.</p>

<p>Thou hast my better years; Thou hast my earlier friends, the good, the kind,</p>

<p>Yielded to thee with tears The venerable form, the exalted mind.</p>

<p>My spirit yearns to bring The lost ones backyearns with desire intense,</p>

<p>And struggles hard to wring Thy bolts apart, and pluck thy captives thence.</p>

<p>In vain; thy gates deny All passage save to those who hence depart;</p>

<p>Nor to the streaming eye Thou giv'st them backnor to the broken heart.</p>

<p>In thy abysses hide Beauty and excellence unknown; to thee</p>

<p>Earth's wonder and her pride Are gathered, as the waters to the sea;</p>

<p>Labors of good to man, Unpublished charity, unbroken faith,</p>

<p>Love, that midst grief began, And grew with years, and faltered not in death.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</p>

<p>Full many a mighty name Lurks in thy depths, unuttered, unrevered;</p>

<p>With thee are silent fame, Forgotten arts, and wisdom disappeared.</p>

<p>Thine for a space are they Yet shalt thou yield thy treasures up at last:</p>

<p>Thy gates shall yet give way, Thy bolts shall fall, inexorable Past I</p>

<p>All that of good and fair Has gone into thy womb from earliest time,</p>

<p>Shall then come forth to wear The glory and the beauty of its prime.</p>

<p>They have not perishedno! Kind words, remembered voices once so sweet,</p>

<p>Smiles, radiant long ago, And features, the great soul's apparent seat.</p>

<p>All shall come back; each tie Of pure affection shall be knit again;</p>

<p>Alone shall Evil die, And Sorrow dwell a prisoner in thy reign.</p>

<p>And then shall I behold Him, by whose kind paternal side I sprung,</p>

<p>And her, who, still and cold, Fills the next gravethe beautiful and young.</p>

<p>To a Waterfowl</p>

<p>Whither, midst falling dew, While glow the heavens with the last steps of day, Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue</p>

<p>Thy solitary way?</p>

<p>Vainly the fowler's eye Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong, As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,</p>

<p>Thy figure floats along.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT 1223</p>

<p>Seek'st thou the plashy brink Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide, Or where the rocking billows rise and sink</p>

<p>On the chafed ocean-side?</p>

<p>There is a Power whose care Teaches thy way along that pathless coast The desert and illimitable air</p>

<p>Lone wandering, but not lost.</p>

<p>All day thy wings have fanned, At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere, Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,</p>

<p>Though the dark night is near.</p>

<p>And soon that toil shall end; Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest, And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,</p>

<p>Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest.</p>

<p>Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given,</p>

<p>And shall not soon depart.</p>

<p>He who, from zone to zone, Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight, In the long way that I must tread alone,</p>

<p>Will lead my steps aright.</p>

<p>The Death of Lincoln</p>

<p>Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,</p>

<p>Gentle and merciful and just! Who, in the fear of God, didst bear</p>

<p>The sword of power, a nation's trust 1</p>

<p>In sorrow by thy bier we stand,</p>

<p>Amid the awe that hushes all, And speak the anguish of a land</p>

<p>That shook with horror at thy fall.</p>

See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore! Come! let the burial rite be readthe funeral song be sung!

<p>In the greenest of our valleys</p>

<p>By good angels tenanted, Once a fair and stately palace</p>

<p>It stood there! Never seraph spread a pinion</p>

<p>Over fabric half so fair!</p>

<p>Banners yellow, glorious, golden,</p>

<p>On its roof did float and flow, (Thisall thiswas in the olden</p>

<p>Time long ago,) And every gentle air that dallied,</p>

<p>In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,</p>

<p>A winged odor went away.</p>

<p>To a lute's well-tuned law, Round about a throne where, sitting,</p>

<p>That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore.</p>

<p>On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,</p>

<p>Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece, And the grandeur that was Rome.</p>

<p>Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand,</p>

<p>The agate lamp within thy hand!</p>

<p>Ah, Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!</p>

<p>The Raven</p>

<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. ' 'Tis some visiter,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more.'</p>

<p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost Lenore For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermore.</p>

<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating ' 'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is and nothing more.'</p>

<p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you'here I opened wide the door; Darkness there and nothing more.</p>

<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>

<p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!' This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word 'Lenore!' Merely this and nothing more.</p>

<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>

<p>1228</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; 'Tis the wind and nothing more!'</p>

<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, 'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven,</p>

<p>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nighdy shore</p>

<p>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered 'Other friends have flown before</p>

<p>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' Then the bird said 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of "Nevernevermore." '</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE 1229</p>

<p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;</p>

<p>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>

<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</p>

<p>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. 'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee</p>

<p>Respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror hauntedtell me truly, I implore Is thereis there balm in Gilead?tell metell me, I implore!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above usby that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>'Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked, upstarting</p>

<p>'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!</p>

<p>> EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'</p>

<p>Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.'</p>

<p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</p>

<p>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be liftednevermore!</p>

<p>Ulalume</p>

<p>The skies they were ashen and sober;</p>

<p>The leaves they were crisped and sere</p>

<p>The leaves they were withering and sere; It was night in the lonesome October</p>

<p>Of my most immemorial year; It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,</p>

<p>In the misty mid region of Weir It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,</p>

<p>In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</p>

<p>Here once, through an alley Titanic,</p>

<p>Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul'</p>

<p>Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul. These were days when my heart was volcanic</p>

<p>As the scoriae rivers that roll</p>

<p>As the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek</p>

<p>In the ultimate climes of the pole That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek</p>

<p>In the realms of the boreal pole.</p>

<p>Our talk had been serious and sober,</p>

<p>But our thoughts they were palsied and sere Our memories were treacherous and sere</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE 1231</p>

<p>For we knew not the month was October,</p>

<p>And we marked not the night of the year</p>

<p>(Ah, night of all nights in the year!) We noted not the dim lake of Auber</p>

<p>(Though once we had journeyed down here) Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,</p>

<p>Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</p>

<p>And now, as the night was senescent</p>

<p>And star-dials pointed to morn</p>

<p>As the star-dials hinted of morn At the end of our path a liquescent</p>

<p>And nebulous lustre was born, Out of which a miraculous crescent</p>

<p>Arose with a duplicate horn Astarte's bediamonded crescent</p>

<p>Distinct with its duplicate horn.</p>

<p>And I said'She is warmer than Dian:</p>

<p>She rolls through an ether of sighs</p>

<p>She revels in a region of sighs: She has seen that the tears are not dry on</p>

<p>These cheeks, where the worm never dies And has come past the stars of the Lion</p>

<p>To point us the path to the skies</p>

<p>To the Lethean peace of the skies Come up, in despite of the Lion,</p>

<p>To shine on us with her bright eyes Come up through the lair of the Lion,</p>

<p>With love in her luminous eyes.'</p>

<p>But Psyche, uplifting her finger,</p>

<p>Said'Sadly this star I mistrust</p>

<p>Her pallor I strangely mistrust: Oh,hasten!oh, let us not linger!</p>

<p>Oh, fly!let us fly!for we must.' In terror she spoke, letting sink her</p>

<p>Wings until they trailed in the dust In agony sobbed, letting sink her</p>

<p>Plumes till they trailed in the dust</p>

<p>Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.</p>

<p>1232 EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>I replied"This is nothing but dreaming: Let us on by this tremulous light! Let us bathe in this crystalline light!</p>

<p>Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming</p>

<p>With Hope and in Beauty to-night:</p>

<p>See!it flickers up the sky through the night!</p>

<p>Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming, And be sure it will lead us aright</p>

<p>We safely may trust to a gleaming That cannot but guide us aright, Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.'</p>

<p>Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her, And tempted her out of her gloom And conquered her scruples and gloom;</p>

<p>And we passed to the end of the vista, But were stopped by the door of a tomb By the door of a legended tomb;</p>

<p>And I said'What is written, sweet sister, On the door of this legended tomb?' She replied'UlalumeUlalume 'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'</p>

<p>Then my heart it grew ashen and sober As the leaves that were crisped and sere As the leaves that were withering and sere,</p>

<p>And I cried'It was surely October On this very night of last year That I journeyedI journeyed down here That I brought a dread burden down here On this night of all nights in the year, Ah, what demon has tempted me here?</p>

<p>Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber This misty mid region of Weir</p>

<p>Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.'</p>

<p>The Bells 1</p>

<p>Hear the sledges with the bells Silver bells!</p>

<p>What a world of merriment their melody foretells! How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,</p>

<p>In the icy air of night! While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens, seem to twinkle</p>

<p>With a crystalline delight; Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme, To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Hear the mellow wedding bells Golden bells! What a world of happiness their harmony foretells! Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight! From the molten-golden notes,</p>

<p>And all in tune, What a liquid ditty floats To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats On the moon! Oh, from out the sounding cells, What a gush of euphony voluminously wells! How it swells! How it dwells On the Future!how it tells Of the rapture that impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>Hear the loud alarum bells Brazen bells! What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! In the starded ear of night How they scream out their affright! Too much horrified to speak, They can only shriek, shriek, Out of tune, In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire, Leaping higher, higher, higher, With a desperate desire, And a resolute endeavor Nownow to sit, or never, By the side of the pale-faced moon. Oh, the bells, bells, bells! What a tale their terror tells Of Despair! How they clang, and clash, and roar! What a horror they outpour On the bosom of the palpitating air! Yet the ear, it fully knows, By the twanging, And the clanging, How the danger ebbs and flows; Yet the ear distincdy tells, In the jangling, And the wrangling, How the danger sinks and swells, By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells Of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells In the clamor and the clanging of the bells!</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Hear the tolling of the bells Iron bells!</p>

<p>What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>In the silence of the night, How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone! For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats</p>

<p>Is a groan. And the peopleah, the people They that dwell up in the steeple,</p>

<p>All alone, And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,</p>

<p>In that muffled monotone, Feel a glory in so rolling</p>

<p>On the human heart a stone They are neither man nor woman They are neither brute nor human</p>

<p>They are Ghouls: And their king it is who tolls: And he rolls, rolls, rolls, Rolls</p>

<p>A paean from the bells! And his merry bosom swells</p>

<p>With the paean of the bells! And he dances, and he yells; Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme,</p>

<p>To the paean of the bells: Of the bells: Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,</p>

<p>To the throbbing of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells:</p>

<p>To the sobbing of the bells: Keeping time, time, time,</p>

<p>As he knells, knells, knells, In a happy Runic rhyme, .</p>

<p>To the rolling of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells</p>

<p>To the tolling of the bells Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.</p>

<p>The moaning and groaning, The sighing and sobbing,</p>

<p>759 To My Mother</p>

<p>Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,</p>

<p>The angels, whispering to one another,</p>

<p>Can find, among their burning terms of love,</p>

<p>None so devotional as that of 'Mother,'</p>

<p>Therefore by that dear name I long have called you</p>

<p>You who are more than mother unto me,</p>

<p>And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,</p>

<p>In setting my Virginia's spirit free.</p>

<p>My mothermy own mother, who died early,</p>

<p>Was but the mother of myself; but you</p>

<p>Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,</p>

<p>And thus are dearer than the mother I knew</p>

<p>By that infinity with which my wife</p>

<p>Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.</p>

<p>760 For Annie Thank Heaven! the crisis</p>

<p>The danger is past, And the lingering illness</p>

<p>Is over at last And the fever called 'Living'</p>

<p>Is conquered at last.</p>

<p>Sadly, I know</p>

<p>I am shorn of my strength,</p>

<p>And no muscle I move As I lie at full length</p>

<p>But no matter!I feel I am better at length.</p>

<p>And I rest so composedly</p>

<p>Now, in my bed, That any beholder</p>

<p>Might fancy me dead Might start at beholding me,</p>

<p>Thinking me dead.</p>

<p>With that horrible throbbing At heart:ah that horrible,</p>

<p>The sicknessthe nausea</p>

<p>The pitiless pain Have ceased with the fever</p>

<p>That maddened my brain With the fever called 'Living'</p>

<p>That burned in my brain.</p>

<p>And oh! of all tortures</p>

<p>That torture the worst Has abatedthe terrible</p>

<p>Torture of thirst For the naphthaline river</p>

<p>Of Passion accurst: I have drank of a water</p>

<p>That quenches all thirst:</p>

<p>Of a water that flows,</p>

<p>With a lullaby sound, From a spring but a very few</p>

<p>Feet under ground From a cavern not very far</p>

<p>Down under ground.</p>

<p>And ah! let it never</p>

<p>Be foolishly said That my room it is gloomy</p>

<p>And narrow my bed; For a man never slept</p>

<p>In a different bed And, to sleep, you must slumber</p>

<p>In just such a bed.</p>

<p>My tantalized spirit Here blandly reposes,</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>Forgetting, or never</p>

<p>Regretting, its roses Its old agitations</p>

<p>Of the tresses of Annie.</p>

<p>She tenderly kissed me,</p>

<p>She fondly caressed, And then I fell gently</p>

<p>To sleep on her breast Deeply to sleep</p>

<p>From the heaven of her breast.</p>

<p>When the light was extinguished,</p>

<p>She covered me warm, And she prayed to the angels</p>

<p>To keep me from harm To the queen of the angels</p>

<p>To shield me from harm.</p>

<p>Now, in my bed, (With her love at my breast)</p>

<p>That you fancy me dead That you shudder to look at me,</p>

<p>But my heart it is brighter</p>

<p>76/ Annabel Lee</p>

<p>It was many and many a year ago,</p>

<p>In a kingdom by the sea That a maiden there lived whom you may know</p>

<p>By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought</p>

<p>Than to love and be loved by me.</p>

<p>/ was a child and she was a child,</p>

<p>In this kingdom by the sea, But we loved with a love that was more than love</p>

<p>I and my Annabel Lee With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven</p>

<p>Coveted her and me.</p>

<p>And this was the reason that, long ago,</p>

<p>In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling</p>

<p>My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her high-born kinsmen came</p>

<p>And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre</p>

<p>In this kingdom by the sea.</p>

<p>EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<p>The angels, not half so happy in heaven,</p>

<p>Went envying her and me Yes!that was the reason (as all men know,</p>

<p>In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</p>

<p>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>

<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</p>

<p>Of those who were older than we</p>

<p>Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in heaven above,</p>

<p>Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</p>

<p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:</p>

<p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams</p>

<p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee, And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes</p>

<p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride,</p>

<p>In the sepulchre there by the sea</p>

<p>In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>

<p>The Conqueror Worm</p>

<p>Lo! 'tis a gala night</p>

<p>Within the lonesome latter years! An angel throng, bewinged, bedight</p>

<p>In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre, to see</p>

<p>A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully</p>

<p>The music of the spheres.</p>

<p>Mimes, in the form of God on high,</p>

<p>Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly</p>

<p>Mere puppets they, who come and go</p>

<p>763 Good-Bye</p>

<p>Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home: Thou art not my friend, and I'm not thine. Long through thy weary crowds I roam;</p>

<p>At bidding of vast formless things</p>

<p>That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings</p>

<p>Invisible Woe!</p>

<p>That modey dramaoh, be  sure</p>

<p>It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom chased for evermore,</p>

<p>By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in</p>

<p>To the self-same spot, And much of Madness, and more of Sin,</p>

<p>And Horror the soul of the plot.</p>

<p>But see, amid the mimic rout</p>

<p>A crawling shape intrude! A blood-red thing that writhes from out</p>

<p>The scenic solitude! It writhes!it writhes!with mortal pangs</p>

<p>The mimes become its food, And seraphs sob at vermin fangs</p>

<p>In human gore imbued.</p>

<p>Outout are the lightsout all!</p>

<p>And, over each quivering form, The curtain, a funeral pall,</p>

<p>Comes down with the rush of a storm, While the angels, all pallid and wan,</p>

<p>Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, 'Man,'</p>

<p>And its hero the Conqueror Worm.</p>

<p>A river-ark on the ocean brine,</p>

<p>Long I've been tossed like the driven foam;</p>

<p>Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face;</p>

<p>To Grandeur with his wise grimace;</p>

<p>To upstart Wealth's averted eye;</p>

<p>To supple Office, low and high;</p>

<p>To frozen hearts and hasting feet;</p>

<p>To those who go, and those who come;</p>

<p>Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home.</p>

<p>I am going to my own hearth-stone, Bosomed in yon green hills alone, A secret nook in a pleasant land, Whose groves the frolic fairies planned; Where arches green, the livelong day, Echo the blackbird's roundelay, And vulgar feet have never trod A spot that is sacred to thought and God.</p>

<p>O, when I am safe in my sylvan home, I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome; And when I am stretched beneath the pines, Where the evening star so holy shines, I laugh at the lore and the pride of man, At the sophist schools and the learned clan; For what are they all, in their high conceit, When man in the bush with God may meet?</p>

<p>Think me not unkind and rude</p>

<p>That I walk alone in grove and glen;</p>

<p>Tax not my sloth that I</p>

<p>Fold my arms beside the brook;</p>

<p>Each cloud that floated in the sky Writes a letter in my book.</p>

<p>Goes home loaded with a thought.</p>

<p>There was never mystery</p>

<p>But 'tis figured in the flowers; Was never secret history</p>

<p>But birds tell it in the bowers.</p>

<p>One harvest from thy field</p>

<p>Homeward brought the oxen strong;</p>

<p>A second crop thine acres yield, Which I gather in a song.</p>

<p>If the red slayer think he slays, Or if the slain think he is slain,</p>

<p>Far or forgot to me is near;</p>

<p>Shadow and sunlight are the same; The vanished gods to me appear;</p>

<p>And one to me are shame and fame.</p>

<p>They reckon ill who leave me out;</p>

<p>When me they fly, I am the wings; I am the doubter and the doubt,</p>

<p>And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.</p>

<p>The strong gods pine for my abode, And pine in vain the sacred Seven;</p>

<p>But thou, meek lover of the good!</p>

<p>Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days, Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes, And marching single in an endless file,</p>

<p>To each they offer gifts after his will,</p>

<p>I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,</p>

<p>Forgot my morning wishes, hastily</p>

<p>Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day</p>

<p>Turned and departed silent. I, too late,</p>

<p>Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.</p>

<p>'Tis a brave master; Let it have scope: Follow it utterly, Hope beyond hope: High and more high It dives into noon, With wing unspent, Untold intent; But it is a god, Knows its own path And the outlets of the sky.</p>

<p>It was never for the mean; It requireth courage stout. Souls above doubt, Valor unbending, It will reward, They shall return More than they were, And ever ascending.</p>

<p>Cling with life to the maid; But when the surprise, First vague shadow of surmise Flits across her bosom young, Of a joy apart from thee, Free be she, fancy-free; Nor thou detain her vesture's hem, Nor the palest rose she flung From her summer diadem.</p>

<p>Though thou loved her as thyself, As a self of purer clay, Though her parting dims the day, Stealing grace from all alive; Heartily know, When half-gods go, The gods arrive.</p>

<p>768 Concord Hymn</p>

<p>Sung at the Completion of the Battle Monument, July 4, 1837</p>

<p>By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,</p>

<p>Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world.</p>

<p>The foe long since in silence slept;</p>

<p>Alike the conqueror silent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept</p>

<p>Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.</p>

<p>On this green bank, by this soft stream,</p>

<p>We set to-day a votive stone; That memory may their deed redeem,</p>

<p>When, like our sires, our sons are gone.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Spirit, that made those heroes dare To die, and leave their children free,</p>

<p>Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.</p>

<p>The Humble-Bee</p>

<p>Burly, dozing humble-bee, Where thou art is clime for me. Let them sail for Porto Rique, Far-off heats through seas to seek; I will follow thee alone, Thou animated torrid-zone! Zigzag steerer, desert cheerer, Let me chase thy waving lines; Keep me nearer, me thy hearer, Singing over shrubs and vines.</p>

<p>Insect lover of the sun, Joy of thy dominion! Sailor of the atmosphere; Swimmer through the waves of air; Voyager of light and noon; Epicurean of June; Wait, I prithee, till I come Within earshot of thy hum, All without is martyrdom.</p>

<p>When the south wind, in May days, With a net of shining haze Silvers the horizon wall, And with softness touching all, Tints the human countenance With a color of romance, And infusing subtle heats, Turns the sod to violets, Thou, in sunny solitudes, Rover of the underwoods, The green silence dost displace With thy mellow, breezy bass.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Hot midsummer's petted crone, Sweet to me thy drowsy tone Tells of coundess sunny hours, Long days, and solid banks of flowers; Of gulfs of sweetness without bound In Indian wildernesses found; Of Syrian peace, immortal leisure, Firmest cheer, and bird-like pleasure.</p>

<p>Aught unsavory or unclean Hath my insect never seen; But violets and bilberry bells, Maple-sap and daffodels, Grass with green flag half-mast high, Succory to match the sky, Columbine with horn of honey, Scented fern, and agrimony, Clover, catchfly, adder's-tongue And brier-roses, dwelt among; All beside was unknown waste, All was picture as he passed.</p>

<p>Wiser far than human seer, Yellow-breeched philosopher! Seeing only what is fair, Sipping only what is sweet, Thou dost mock at fate and care, Leave the chaff, and take the wheat. When the fierce northwestern blast Cools sea and land so far and fast, Thou already slumberest deep; Woe and want thou canst outsleep; Want and woe, which torture us, Thy sleep makes ridiculous.</p>

<p>770 The Problem</p>

<p>I like a church; I like a cowl;</p>

<p>I love a prophet of the soul;</p>

<p>And on my heart monastic aisles</p>

<p>Fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles;</p>

<p>Yet not for all his faith can see</p>

<p>Would I that cowled churchman be.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Why should the vest on him allure, Which I could not on me endure?</p>

<p>Not from a vain or shallow thought</p>

<p>His awful Jove young Phidias brought;</p>

<p>Never from lips of cunning fell</p>

<p>The thrilling Delphic oracle;</p>

<p>Out from the heart of nature rolled</p>

<p>The burdens of the Bible old;</p>

<p>The litanies of nations came,</p>

<p>Like the volcano's tongue of flame,</p>

<p>Up from the burning core below,</p>

<p>The canticles of love and woe:</p>

<p>The hand that rounded Peter's dome</p>

<p>And groined the aisles of Christian Rome</p>

<p>Wrought in a sad sincerity:</p>

<p>Himself from God he could not free;</p>

<p>He builded better than he knew;</p>

<p>The conscious stone to beauty grew.</p>

<p>Know'st thou what wove yon woodbird's nest</p>

<p>Of leaves, and feathers from her breast?</p>

<p>Or how the fish outbuilt her shell,</p>

<p>Painting with morn each annual cell?</p>

<p>Or how the sacred pine-tree adds</p>

<p>To her old leaves new myriads?</p>

<p>Such and so grew these holy piles,</p>

<p>Whilst love and terror laid the tiles.</p>

<p>Earth proudly wears the Parthenon,</p>

<p>As the best gem upon her zone,</p>

<p>And Morning opes with haste her lids</p>

<p>To gaze upon the Pyramids;</p>

<p>O'er England's abbeys bends the sky,</p>

<p>As on its friends, with kindred eye;</p>

<p>For out of Thought's interior sphere</p>

<p>These wonders rose to upper air;</p>

<p>And Nature gladly gave them place,</p>

<p>Adopted them into her race,</p>

<p>And granted them an equal date</p>

<p>With Andes and with Ararat.</p>

<p>These temples grew as grows the grass;</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Art might obey, but not surpass.</p>

<p>The passive Master lent his hand</p>

<p>To the vast soul that o'er him planned;</p>

<p>And the same power that reared the shrine</p>

<p>Bestrode the tribes that knelt within.</p>

<p>Ever the fiery Pentecost</p>

<p>Girds with one flame the countless host,</p>

<p>Trances the heart through chanting choirs,</p>

<p>And through the priest the mind inspires.</p>

<p>The word unto the prophet spoken</p>

<p>Was writ on tables yet unbroken;</p>

<p>The word by seers or sibyls told,</p>

<p>In groves of oak, or fanes of gold,</p>

<p>Still floats upon the morning wind,</p>

<p>Still whispers to the willing mind.</p>

<p>One accent of the Holy Ghost</p>

<p>The heedless world hath never lost.</p>

<p>I know what say the fathers wise,</p>

<p>The Book itself before me lies,</p>

<p>Old Chrysostom, best Augustine,</p>

<p>And he who blent both in his line,</p>

<p>The younger Golden Lips or mines,</p>

<p>Taylor, the Shakspeare of divines.</p>

<p>His words are music in my ear,</p>

<p>I see his cowled portrait dear;</p>

<p>And yet, for all his faith could see,</p>

<p>I would not the good bishop be.</p>

<p>Woodnotes</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>When the pine tosses its cones To the song of its waterfall tones, Who speeds to the woodland walks? To birds and trees who talks? Caesar of his leafy Rome, There the poet is at home. He goes to the river-side, Not hook nor line hath he;</p>

<p>I25O RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>He stands in the meadows wide, Nor gun nor scythe to see. Sure some god his eye enchants: What he knows nobody wants. In the wood he travels glad, Without better fortune had, Melancholy without bad. Knowledge this man prizes best Seems fantastic to the rest: Pondering shadows, colors, clouds, Grass-buds and caterpillar-shrouds, Boughs on which the wild bees settle, Tints that spot the violet's petal, Why Nature loves the number five, And why the star-form she repeats: Lover of all things alive, Wonderer at all he meets, Wonderer chiefly at himself, Who can tell him what he is? Or how meet in human elf Coming and past eternities?</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>And such I knew, a forest seer,</p>

<p>A minstrel of the natural year,</p>

<p>Foreteller of the vernal ides,</p>

<p>Wise harbinger of spheres and tides,</p>

<p>A lover true, who knew by heart</p>

<p>Each joy the mountain dales impart;</p>

<p>It seemed that Nature could not raise</p>

<p>A plant in any secret place,</p>

<p>In quaking bog, on snowy hill,</p>

<p>Beneath the grass that shades the rill,</p>

<p>Under the snow, between the rocks,</p>

<p>In damp fields known to bird and fox,</p>

<p>But he would come in the very hour</p>

<p>It opened in its virgin bower,</p>

<p>As if a sunbeam showed the place,</p>

<p>And tell its long-descended race.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the breezes brought him,</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>1251</p>

<p>It seemed as if the sparrows taught him; As if by secret sight he knew Where, in far fields, the orchis grew. Many haps fall in the field Seldom seen by wishful eyes, But all her shows did Nature yield, To please and win this pilgrim wise. He saw the partridge drum in the woods; He heard the woodcock's evening hymn; He found the tawny thrushes' broods; And the shy hawk did wait for him; What others did at distance hear, And guessed within the thicket's gloom, Was shown to this philosopher, And at his bidding seemed to come.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>In unploughed Maine he sought the lumberers' gang Where from a hundred lakes young rivers sprang; He trode the unplanted forest floor, whereon The all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone; Where feeds the moose, and walks the surly bear, And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker. He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds, The slight Linnaea hang its twin-born heads, And blessed the monument of the man of flowers, Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers. He heard, when in the grove, at intervals, With sudden roar the aged pine-tree falls, One crash, the death-hymn of the perfect tree, Declares the close of its green century. Low lies the plant to whose creation went Sweet influence from every element; Whose living towers the years conspired to build, Whose giddy top the morning loved to gild. Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed, He roamed, content alike with man and beast. Where darkness found him he lay glad at night; There the red morning touched him with its light. Three moons his great heart him a hermit made,</p>

<p>1252 RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>So long he roved at will the boundless shade. The timid it concerns to ask their way, And fear what foe in caves and swamps can stray, To make no step until the event is known, And ills to come as evils past bemoan. Not so the wise; no coward watch he keeps To spy what danger on his pathway creeps; Go where he will, the wise man is at home, His hearth the earth,his hall the azure dome; Where his clear spirit leads him, there's his road By God's own light illumined and foreshowed.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>'Twas one of the charmed days</p>

<p>When the genius of God doth flow;</p>

<p>The wind may alter twenty ways,</p>

<p>A tempest cannot blow;</p>

<p>It may blow north, it still is warm;</p>

<p>Or south, it still is clear;</p>

<p>Or east, it smells like a clover-farm;</p>

<p>Or west, no thunder fear.</p>

<p>The musing peasant, lowly great,</p>

<p>Beside the forest water sate;</p>

<p>The rope-like pine-roots crosswise grown</p>

<p>Composed the network of his throne;</p>

<p>The wide lake, edged with sand and grass,</p>

<p>Was burnished to a floor of glass,</p>

<p>Painted with shadows green and proud</p>

<p>Of the tree and of the cloud.</p>

<p>He was the heart of all the scene;</p>

<p>On him the sun looked more serene;</p>

<p>To hill and cloud his face was known,</p>

<p>It seemed the likeness of their own;</p>

<p>They knew by secret sympathy</p>

<p>The public child of earth and sky.</p>

<p>'You ask,' he said, 'what guide</p>

<p>Me through trackless thickets led,</p>

<p>Through thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide,</p>

<p>I found the water's bed.</p>

<p>The watercourses were my guide;</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>I travelled grateful by their side,</p>

<p>Or through their channel dry;</p>

<p>They led me through the thicket damp,</p>

<p>Through brake and fern, the beavers' camp,</p>

<p>Through beds of granite cut my road,</p>

<p>And their resistless friendship showed.</p>

<p>The falling waters led me,</p>

<p>The foodful waters fed me,</p>

<p>And brought me to the lowest land,</p>

<p>Unerring to the ocean sand.</p>

<p>The moss upon the forest bark</p>

<p>Was pole-star when the night was dark;</p>

<p>The purple berries in the wood</p>

<p>Supplied me necessary food;</p>

<p>For Nature ever faithful is</p>

<p>To such as trust her faithfulness.</p>

<p>When the forest shall mislead me,</p>

<p>When the night and morning lie,</p>

<p>When sea and land refuse to feed me,</p>

<p>'Twill be time enough to die;</p>

<p>Then will yet my mother yield</p>

<p>A pillow in her greenest field,</p>

<p>Nor the June flowers scorn to cover</p>

<p>The clay of their departed lover.'</p>

<p>Woodnotes II</p>

<p>As sunbeams stream through liberal space And nothing jostle or displace, So waved the pine-tree through my thought And fanned the dreams it never brought.</p>

<p>'Whether is better, the gift or the donor?</p>

<p>Come to me,'</p>

<p>Quoth the pine-tree,</p>

<p>'I am the giver of honor.</p>

<p>My garden is the cloven rock,</p>

<p>And my manure the snow;</p>

<p>And drifting sand-heaps feed my stock,</p>

<p>In summer's scorching glow.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>He is great who can live by me: The rough and bearded forester Is better than the lord; God fills the scrip and canister, Sin piles the loaded board. The lord is the peasant that was, The peasant the lord that shall be; The lord is hay, the peasant grass, One dry, and one the living tree. Who liveth by the ragged pine Foundeth a heroic line; Who liveth in the palace hall Waneth fast and spendeth all. He goes to my savage haunts, With his chariot and his care; My twilight realm he disenchants, And finds his prison there.</p>

<p>'What prizes the town and the tower?</p>

<p>Only what the pine-tree yields;</p>

<p>Sinew that subdued the fields;</p>

<p>The wild-eyed boy, who in the woods</p>

<p>Chants his hymn to hills and floods,</p>

<p>Whom the city's poisoning spleen</p>

<p>Made not pale, or fat, or lean;</p>

<p>Whom the rain and the wind purgeth,</p>

<p>Whom the dawn and the day-star urgeth,</p>

<p>In whose cheek the rose-leaf blusheth,</p>

<p>In whose feet the lion rusheth</p>

<p>Iron arms, and iron mould,</p>

<p>That know not fear, fatigue, or cold.</p>

<p>I give my rafters to his boat,</p>

<p>My billets to his boiler's throat,</p>

<p>And I will swim the ancient sea</p>

<p>To float my child to victory,</p>

<p>And grant to dwellers with the pine</p>

<p>Dominion o'er the palm and vine.</p>

<p>Who leaves the pine-tree, leaves his friend,</p>

<p>Unnerves his strength, invites his end.</p>

<p>Cut a bough from my parent stem,</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>And dip it in thy porcelain vase;</p>

<p>A little while each russet gem</p>

<p>Will swell and rise with wonted grace;</p>

<p>But when it seeks enlarged supplies,</p>

<p>The orphan of the forest dies.</p>

<p>Whoso walks in solitude</p>

<p>And inhabiteth the wood,</p>

<p>Choosing light, wave, rock and bird,</p>

<p>Before the money-loving herd,</p>

<p>Into that forester shall pass,</p>

<p>From these companions, power and grace.</p>

<p>Clean shall he be, without, within,</p>

<p>From the old adhering sin,</p>

<p>All ill dissolving in the light</p>

<p>Of his triumphant piercing sight:</p>

<p>Not vain, sour, nor frivolous;</p>

<p>Not mad, athirst, nor garrulous;</p>

<p>Grave, chaste, contented, though retired,</p>

<p>And of all other men desired.</p>

<p>On him the light of star and moon</p>

<p>Shall fall with purer radiance down;</p>

<p>All constellations of the sky</p>

<p>Shed their virtue through his eye.</p>

<p>Him Nature giveth for defence</p>

<p>His formidable innocence;</p>

<p>The mountain sap, the shells, the sea,</p>

<p>All spheres, all stones, his helpers be;</p>

<p>He shall meet the speeding year,</p>

<p>Without wailing, without fear;</p>

<p>He shall be happy in his love,</p>

<p>Like to like shall joyful prove;</p>

<p>He shall be happy whilst he wooes,</p>

<p>Muse-born, a daughter of the Muse.</p>

<p>But if with gold she bind her hair,</p>

<p>And deck her breast with diamond,</p>

<p>Take off thine eyes, thy heart forbear,</p>

<p>Though thou lie alone on the ground.</p>

<p>'Heed the old oracles, Ponder my spells;</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Song wakes in my pinnacles</p>

<p>When the wind swells.</p>

<p>Soundeth the prophetic wind,</p>

<p>The shadows shake on the rock behind,</p>

<p>And the countless leaves of the pine are strings</p>

<p>Tuned to the lay the wood-god sings.</p>

<p>Hearken! Hearken! If thou wouldst know the mystic song Chanted when the sphere was young. Aloft, abroad, the pxan swells; O wise man! hear'st thou half it tells? O wise man! hear'st thou the least part? 'Tis the chronicle of art. To the open ear it sings Sweet the genesis of things, Of tendency through endless ages, Of star-dust, and star-pilgrimages, Of rounded worlds, of space and time, Of the old flood's subsiding slime, Of chemic matter, force and form, Of poles and powers, cold, wet, and warm: The rushing metamorphosis Dissolving all that fixture is, Melts things that be to things that seem, And solid nature to a dream. O, listen to the undersong, The ever old, the ever young; And, far within those cadent pauses, The chorus of the ancient Causes! Delights the dreadful Destiny To fling his voice into the tree, And shock thy weak ear with a note Breathed from the everlasting throat. In music he repeats the pang Whence the fair flock of Nature sprang. O mortal! thy ears are stones; These echoes are laden with tones Which only the pure can hear; Thou canst not catch what they recite Of Fate and Will, of Want and Right,</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Of man to come, of human life,</p>

<p>Of Death and Fortune, Growth and Strife.'</p>

<p>Once again the pine-tree sung: 'Speak not thy speech my boughs among: Put off thy years, wash in the breeze; My hours are peaceful centuries. Talk no more with feeble tongue; No more the fool of space and time, Come weave with mine a nobler rhyme. Only thy Americans Can read thy line, can meet thy glance, But the runes that I rehearse Understands the universe; The least breath my boughs which tossed Brings again the Pentecost; To every soul resounding clear In a voice of solemn cheer, "Am I not thine? Are not these thine?" And they reply, "Forever mine!" My branches speak Italian, English, German, Basque, Castilian, Mountain speech to Highlanders, Ocean tongues to islanders, To Fin and Lap and swart Malay, To each his bosom-secret say.</p>

<p>'Come learn with me the fatal song Which knits the world in music strong, Come lift thine eyes to lofty rhymes, Of things with things, of times with times, Primal chimes of sun and shade, Of sound and echo, man and maid, The land reflected in the flood, Body with shadow still pursued. For Nature beats in perfect tune, And rounds with rhyme her every rune, Whether she work in land or sea, Or hide underground her alchemy. Thou canst not wave thy staff in air,</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Or dip thy paddle in the lake,</p>

<p>But it carves the bow of beauty there,</p>

<p>And the ripples in rhymes the oar forsake.</p>

<p>The wood is wiser far than thou;</p>

<p>The wood and wave each other know</p>

<p>Not unrelated, unaiSed,</p>

<p>But to each thought and thing allied,</p>

<p>Is perfect Nature's every part,</p>

<p>Rooted in the mighty Heart.</p>

<p>But thou, poor child! unbound, unrhymed,</p>

<p>Whence earnest thou, misplaced, mistimed,</p>

<p>Whence, O thou orphan and defrauded ?</p>

<p>Is thy land peeled, thy realm marauded ?</p>

<p>Who thee divorced, deceived and left?</p>

<p>Thee of thy faith who hath bereft,</p>

<p>And torn the ensigns from thy brow,</p>

<p>And sunk the immortal eye so low ?</p>

<p>Thy cheek too white, thy form too slender,</p>

<p>Thy gait too slow, thy habits tender</p>

<p>For royal man;they thee confess</p>

<p>An exile from the wilderness,</p>

<p>The hills where health with health agrees,</p>

<p>And the wise soul expels disease.</p>

<p>Hark! in thy ear I will tell the sign</p>

<p>By which thy hurt thou may'st divine.</p>

<p>When thou shalt climb the mountain cliff,</p>

<p>Or see the wide shore from thy skiff,</p>

<p>To thee the horizon shall express</p>

<p>But emptiness on emptiness;</p>

<p>There lives no man of Nature's worth</p>

<p>In the circle of the earth;</p>

<p>And to thine eye the vast skies fall,</p>

<p>Dire and satirical,</p>

<p>On clucking hens and prating fools, On thieves, on drudges and on dolls. And thou shalt say to the Most High, "Godhead! all this astronomy, And fate and practice and invention, Strong art and beautiful pretension, This radiant pomp of sun and star,</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Throes that were, and worlds that are, Behold! were in vain and in vain; It cannot be,I will look again. Surely now will the curtain rise, And earth's fit tenant me surprise; But the curtain doth not rise, And Nature has miscarried wholly Into failure, into folly."</p>

<p>'Alas! thine is the bankruptcy,</p>

<p>Blessed Nature so to see.</p>

<p>Come, lay thee in my soothing shade,</p>

<p>And heal the hurts which sin has made.</p>

<p>I see thee in the crowd alone;</p>

<p>I will be thy companion.</p>

<p>Quit thy friends as the dead in doom,</p>

<p>And build to them a final tomb;</p>

<p>Let the starred shade that nightly falls</p>

<p>Still celebrate their funerals,</p>

<p>And the bell of beetle and of bee</p>

<p>Knell their melodious memory.</p>

<p>Behind thee leave thy merchandise,</p>

<p>Thy churches and thy charities;</p>

<p>And leave thy peacock wit behind;</p>

<p>Enough for thee the primal mind</p>

<p>That flows in streams, that breathes in wind</p>

<p>Leave all thy pedant lore apart;</p>

<p>God hid the whole world in thy heart.</p>

<p>Love shuns the sage, the child it crowns,</p>

<p>Gives all to them who all renounce.</p>

<p>The rain comes when the wind calls;</p>

<p>The river knows the way to the sea;</p>

<p>Without a pilot it runs and falls,</p>

<p>Blessing all lands with its charity;</p>

<p>The sea tosses and foams to find</p>

<p>Its way up to the cloud and wind;</p>

<p>The shadow sits close to the flying ball;</p>

<p>The date fails not on the palm-tree tall;</p>

<p>And thou,go burn thy wormy pages,</p>

<p>Shalt outsee seers, and outwit sages.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>Oft didst thou thread the woods in vain To find what bird had piped the strain: Seek not, and the little eremite Flies gayly forth and sings in sight.</p>

<p>'Hearken once more!</p>

<p>I will tell thee the mundane lore.</p>

<p>Older am I than thy numbers wot,</p>

<p>Change I may, but I pass not.</p>

<p>Hitherto all things fast abide,</p>

<p>And anchored in the tempest ride.</p>

<p>Trenchant time behoves to hurry</p>

<p>All to yean and all to bury:</p>

<p>All the forms are fugitive,</p>

<p>But the substances survive.</p>

<p>Ever fresh the broad creation,</p>

<p>A divine improvisation,</p>

<p>From the heart of God proceeds,</p>

<p>A single will, a million deeds.</p>

<p>Once slept the world an egg of stone,</p>

<p>And pulse, and sound, and light was none;</p>

<p>And God said, "Throb!" and there was motion</p>

<p>And the vast mass became vast ocean.</p>

<p>Onward and on, the eternal Pan,</p>

<p>Who layeth the world's incessant plan,</p>

<p>Halteth never in one shape,</p>

<p>But forever doth escape,</p>

<p>Like wave or flame, into new forms</p>

<p>Of gem, and air, of plants, and worms.</p>

<p>I, that to-day am a pine,</p>

<p>772 Boston Hymn</p>

<p>read in music hall, january i, 18631 The word of the Lord by night To the watching Pilgrims came, As they sat by the seaside, And filled their hearts with flame. 1 The day when the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>

<p>God said, I am tired of kings, I suffer them no more; Up to my ear the morning brings The outrage of the poor.</p>

<p>Think ye I made this ball</p>

<p>A field of havoc and war,</p>

<p>Where tyrants great and tyrants small</p>

<p>Might harry the weak and poor?</p>

<p>My angel,his name is Freedom, Choose him to be your king; He shall cut pathways east and west And fend you with his wing.</p>

<p>Lo! I uncover the land Which I hid of old time in the West, As the sculptor uncovers the statue When he has wrought his best;</p>

<p>I show Columbia, of the rocks Which dip their foot in the seas And soar to the air-borne flocks Of clouds and the boreal fleece.</p>

<p>I will divide my goods; Call in the wretch and slave: None shall rule but the humble, And none but Toil shall have.</p>

<p>I will have never a noble, No lineage counted great; Fishers and choppers and ploughmen Shall constitute a state.</p>

<p>Go, cut down trees in the forest And trim the straightest boughs; Cut down trees in the forest And build me a wooden house.</p>

<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON 1263</p>

<p>Call the people together, The young men and the sires, The digger in the harvest-field, Hireling and him that hires;</p>

<p>And here in a pine state-house They shall choose men to rule In every needful faculty, In church and state and school.</p>

<p>Lo, now! if these poor men Can govern the land and sea And make just laws below the sun, As planets faithful be.</p>

<p>And ye shall succor men;</p>

<p>'Tis nobleness to serve;</p>

<p>Help them who cannot help again:</p>

<p>Beware from right to swerve.</p>

<p>I break your bonds and masterships, And I unchain the slave: Free be his heart and hand henceforth As wind and wandering wave.</p>

<p>I cause from every creature His proper good to flow: As much as he is and doeth, So much he shall bestow.</p>

<p>But, lay hands on another To coin his labor and sweat, He goes in pawn for his victim For eternal years in debt.</p>

<p>To-day unbind the captive, So only are ye unbound; Lift up a people from the dust, Trump of their rescue, sound!</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Pay ransom to the owner</p>

<p>And fill the bag to the brim.</p>

<p>Who is the owner? The slave is owner,</p>

<p>And ever was. Pay him.</p>

<p>O North! give him beauty for rags, And honor, O South! for his shame; Nevada! coin thy golden crags With Freedom's image and name.</p>

<p>Up! and the dusky race That sat in darkness long, Be swift their feet as antelopes, And as behemoth strong.</p>

<p>Come, East and West and North, By races, as snow flakes, And carry my purpose forth, Which neither halts nor shakes.</p>

<p>My will fulfilled shall be, For, in daylight or in dark, My thunderbolt has eyes to see His way home to the mark.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW [7807-/882]</p>

<p>A Psalm of Life</p>

<p>what the heart of the young man said to the psalmist</p>

<p>Tell me not, in mournful numbers,</p>

<p>Life is but an empty dream! For the soul is dead that slumbers,</p>

<p>And things are not what they seem.</p>

<p>Life is real! Life is earnest!</p>

<p>And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest,</p>

<p>Was not spoken of the soul.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,</p>

<p>Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrow</p>

<p>Find us farther than to-day.</p>

<p>Art is long, and Time is fleeting,</p>

<p>And our hearts, though stout and brave,</p>

<p>Still, like muffled drums, are beating Funeral marches to the grave.</p>

<p>In the world's broad field of battle,</p>

<p>In the bivouac of Life, Be not like dumb, driven catde!</p>

<p>Be a hero in the strife!</p>

<p>Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!</p>

<p>Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,act in the living Present!</p>

<p>Heart within, and God o'erhead!</p>

<p>Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime,</p>

<p>And, departing, leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time;</p>

<p>Footprints, that perhaps another, Sailing o'er life's solemn main,</p>

<p>A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, Seeing, shall take heart again.</p>

<p>Let us, then, be up and doing,</p>

<p>With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing,</p>

<p>Learn to labor and to wait.</p>

<p>The Light of Stars The night is come, but not too soon;</p>

<p>And sinking silently, All silently, the little moon</p>

<p>Drops down behind the sky.</p>

<p>1266</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>There is no light in earth or heaven</p>

<p>But the cold light of stars; And the first watch of night is given</p>

<p>To the red planet Mars.</p>

<p>Is it the tender star of love?</p>

<p>The star of love and dreams? Oh no! from that blue tent above</p>

<p>A hero's armor gleams.</p>

<p>And earnest thoughts within me rise,</p>

<p>When I behold afar, Suspended in the evening skies,</p>

<p>The shield of that red star.</p>

<p>0 star of strength! I see thee stand And smile upon my pain;</p>

<p>Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand, And I am strong again.</p>

<p>Within my breast there is no light But the cold light of stars;</p>

<p>1 give the first watch of the night To the red planet Mars.</p>

<p>The star of the unconquered will,</p>

<p>He rises in my breast, Serene, and resolute, and still,</p>

<p>And calm, and self-possessed.</p>

<p>And thou, too, whosoe'er thou art, That readest this brief psalm,</p>

<p>As one by one thy hopes depart, Be resolute and calm.</p>

<p>Oh, fear not in a world like this, And thou shalt know erelong,</p>

<p>Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Hymn to the Night Aairaait], tpixxioros</p>

<p>I heard the trailing garments of the Night</p>

<p>Sweep through her marble halls! I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light</p>

<p>From the celestial walls!</p>

<p>I felt her presence, by its spell of might,</p>

<p>Stoop o'er me from above; The calm, majestic presence of the Night,</p>

<p>As of the one I love.</p>

<p>I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,</p>

<p>The manifold, soft chimes, That fill the haunted chambers of the Night,</p>

<p>Like some old poet's rhymes.</p>

<p>From the cool cisterns of the midnight air</p>

<p>My spirit drank repose; The fountain of perpetual peace flows there,</p>

<p>From those deep cisterns flows.</p>

<p>O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear</p>

<p>What man has borne before! Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,</p>

<p>And they complain no more.</p>

<p>Peace! Peace! Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!</p>

<p>Descend with broad-winged flight, The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,</p>

<p>The best-beloved Night!</p>

<p>Footsteps of Angels</p>

<p>When the hours of Day are numbered,</p>

<p>And the voices of the Night Wake the better soul, that slumbered,</p>

<p>To a holy, calm delight;</p>

<p>1268</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Ere the evening lamps are lighted, And, like phantoms grim and tall,</p>

<p>Shadows from the fitful firelight Dance upon the parlor wall;</p>

<p>Then the forms of the departed</p>

<p>Enter at the open door; The beloved, the true-hearted,</p>

<p>Come to visit me once more;</p>

<p>He, the young and strong, who cherished Noble longings for the strife,</p>

<p>By the roadside fell and perished, Weary with the march of life!</p>

<p>They, the holy ones and weakly, Who the cross of suffering bore,</p>

<p>Folded their pale hands so meekly, Spake with us on earth no more!</p>

<p>And with them the Being Beauteous, Who unto my youth was given,</p>

<p>More than all things else to love me, And is now a saint in heaven.</p>

<p>With a slow and noiseless footstep Comes that messenger divine,</p>

<p>Takes the vacant chair beside me, Lays her gende hand in mine.</p>

<p>And she sits and gazes at me</p>

<p>With those deep and tender eyes,</p>

<p>Like the stars, so still and saint-like, Looking downward from the skies.</p>

<p>Uttered not, yet comprehended, Is the spirit's voiceless prayer,</p>

<p>Soft rebukes, in blessings ended, Breathing from her lips of air.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Oh, though oft depressed and lonely,</p>

<p>All my fears are laid aside, If I but remember only</p>

<p>Such as these have lived and died!</p>

<p>The Wreck of the Hesperus It was the schooner Hesperus,</p>

<p>That sailed the wintry sea; And the skipper had taken his little daughter,</p>

<p>To bear him company.</p>

<p>Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax, Her cheeks like the dawn of day,</p>

<p>And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds, That ope in the month of May.</p>

<p>The skipper he stood beside the helm,</p>

<p>His pipe was in his mouth, And he watched how the veering flaw did blow</p>

<p>The smoke now West, now South.</p>

<p>Then up and spake an old Sailor, Had sailed to the Spanish Main,</p>

<p>'I pray thee, put into yonder port, For I fear a hurricane.</p>

<p>'Last night, the moon had a golden ring,</p>

<p>And to-night no moon we see!' The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,</p>

<p>And a scornful laugh laughed he.</p>

<p>Colder and louder blew the wind,</p>

<p>A gale from the Northeast, The snow fell hissing in the brine,</p>

<p>And the billows frothed like yeast.</p>

<p>Down came the storm, and smote amain</p>

<p>The vessel in its strength; She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,</p>

<p>Then leaped her cable's length.</p>

<p>1270 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>'Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,</p>

<p>And do not tremble so; For I can weather the roughest gale</p>

<p>That ever wind did blow.'</p>

<p>He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat</p>

<p>Against the stinging blast; He cut a rope from a broken spar,</p>

<p>And bound her to the mast.</p>

<p>'O father! I hear the church-bells ring,</p>

<p>Oh say, what may it be?' ' 'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!'</p>

<p>And he steered for the open sea.</p>

<p>'O father! I hear the sound of guns,</p>

<p>Oh say, what may it be?' 'Some ship in distress, that cannot live</p>

<p>In such an angry sea!'</p>

<p>'O father. I see a gleaming light,</p>

<p>Oh say, what may it be?' But the father answered never a word,</p>

<p>A frozen corpse was he.</p>

<p>Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark, With his face turned to the skies,</p>

<p>The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow On his fixed and glassy eyes.</p>

<p>Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed</p>

<p>That saved she might be; And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,</p>

<p>On the Lake of Galilee.</p>

<p>And fast through the midnight dark and drear, Through the whistling sleet and snow,</p>

<p>Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>And ever the fitful gusts between A sound came from the land;</p>

<p>It was the sound of the trampling surf On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.</p>

<p>The breakers were right beneath her bows,</p>

<p>She drifted a dreary wreck, And a whooping billow swept the crew</p>

<p>Like icicles from her deck.</p>

<p>She struck where the white and fleecy waves</p>

<p>Looked soft as carded wool, But the cruel rocks, they gored her side</p>

<p>Like the horns of an angry bull.</p>

<p>Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice, With the masts went by the board;</p>

<p>Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank, Ho! ho! the breakers roared!</p>

<p>At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,</p>

<p>A fisherman stood aghast, To see the form of a maiden fair,</p>

<p>Lashed close to a drifting mast.</p>

<p>The salt sea was frozen on her breast,</p>

<p>The salt tears in her eyes; And he saw her hair, like the brown seaweed,</p>

<p>On the billows fall and rise.</p>

<p>Such was the wreck of the Hesperus, In the midnight and the snow!</p>

<p>Christ save us all from a death like this, On the reef of Norman's Woe!</p>

<p>The Village Blacksmith</p>

<p>Under a spreading chestnut-tree</p>

<p>The village smithy stands; The smith, a mighty man is he,</p>

<p>With large and sinewy hands; And the muscles of his brawny arm</p>

<p>Are strong as iron bands.</p>

<p>1272 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>His hair is crisp, and black, and long,</p>

<p>His face is like the tan; His brow is wet with honest sweat,</p>

<p>He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world in the face,</p>

<p>For he owes not any man.</p>

<p>Week in, week out, from morn till night, You can hear his bellows blow;</p>

<p>You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, With measured beat and slow,</p>

<p>Like a sexton ringing the village bell, When the evening sun is low.</p>

<p>And children coming home from school Look in at the open door;</p>

<p>They love to see the flaming forge, And hear the bellows roar,</p>

<p>And catch the burning sparks that fly, Like chaff from a threshing-floor.</p>

<p>He goes on Sunday to the church, And sits among his boys;</p>

<p>He hears the parson pray and preach, He hears his daughter's voice,</p>

<p>Singing in the village choir, And it makes his heart rejoice..</p>

<p>It sounds to him like her mother's voice,</p>

<p>Singing in Paradise! He needs must think of her once more</p>

<p>How in the grave she lies; And with his hard, rough hand he wipes</p>

<p>A tear out of his eyes.</p>

<p>Toiling,rejoicing,sorrowing, Onward through life he goes;</p>

<p>Each morning sees some task begin, Each evening sees it close;</p>

<p>Something attempted, something done, Has earned a night's repose.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1273</p>

<p>Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,</p>

<p>For the lesson thou hast taught! Thus at the flaming forge of life</p>

<p>Our fortunes must be wrought; Thus on its sounding anvil shaped</p>

<p>Each burning deed and thought.</p>

<p>779 Serenade</p>

<p>from 'the spanish student'</p>

<p>Stars of the summer night!</p>

<p>Far in yon azure deeps, Hide, hide your golden light!</p>

<p>She sleeps! My lady sleeps!</p>

<p>Sleeps!</p>

<p>Moon of the summer night!</p>

<p>Far down yon western steeps, Sink, sink in silver light!</p>

<p>She sleeps! My lady sleeps!</p>

<p>Sleeps!</p>

<p>Wind of the summer night!</p>

<p>Where yonder woodbine creeps, Fold, fold thy pinions light!</p>

<p>She sleeps! My lady sleeps!</p>

<p>Sleeps!</p>

<p>Dreams of the summer night!</p>

<p>Tell her, her lover keeps Watch! while in slumbers light</p>

<p>She sleeps! My lady sleeps!</p>

<p>Sleeps!</p>

<p>780 The Rainy Day</p>

<p>The day is cold, and dark, and dreary; It rains, and the wind is never weary;</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>The vine still clings to the mouldering wall, But at every gust the dead leaves fall, And the day is dark and dreary.</p>

<p>My life is cold, and dark, and dreary; It rains, and the wind is never weary; My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past, But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast, And the days are dark and dreary.</p>

<p>Be still, sad heart! and cease repining; Behind the clouds is the sun still shining; Thy fate is the common fate of all, Into each life some rain must fall,</p>

<p>Some days must be dark and dreary.</p>

<p>781 The Day Is Done</p>

<p>The day is done, and the darkness Falls from the wings of Night,</p>

<p>As a feather is wafted downward From an eagle in his flight.</p>

<p>I see the lights of the village</p>

<p>Gleam through the rain and the mist,</p>

<p>And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me That my soul cannot resist:</p>

<p>A feeling of sadness and longing,</p>

<p>That is not akin to pain, And resembles sorrow only</p>

<p>As the mist resembles the rain.</p>

<p>Come, read to me some poem, Some simple and heartfelt lay,</p>

<p>That shall soothe this restless feeling, And banish the thoughts of day.</p>

<p>Not from the grand old masters, Not from the bards sublime,</p>

<p>Whose distant footsteps echo Through the corridors of Time.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>For, like strains of martial music, Their mighty thoughts suggest</p>

<p>Life's endless toil and endeavor; And to-night I long for rest.</p>

<p>Read from some humbler poet,</p>

<p>Whose songs gushed from his heart,</p>

<p>As showers from the clouds of summer, Or tears from the eyelids start;</p>

<p>Who, through long days of labor,</p>

<p>And nights devoid of ease, Still heard in his soul the music</p>

<p>Of wonderful melodies.</p>

<p>Such songs have power to quiet</p>

<p>The restless pulse of care, And come like the benediction</p>

<p>That follows after prayer.</p>

<p>Then read from the treasured volume</p>

<p>The poem of thy choice, And lend to the rhyme of the poet</p>

<p>The beauty of thy voice.</p>

<p>And the night shall be filled with music, And the cares, that infest the day,</p>

<p>Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs, And as silently steal away.</p>

<p>The Bridge</p>

<p>I stood on the bridge at midnight, As the clocks were striking the hour,</p>

<p>And the moon rose o'er the city, Behind the dark church-tower.</p>

<p>I saw her bright reflection</p>

<p>In the waters under me, Like a golden goblet falling</p>

<p>And sinking into the sea.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>And far in the hazy distance</p>

<p>Of that lovely night in June, The blaze of the flaming furnace</p>

<p>Gleamed redder than the moon.</p>

<p>Among the long, black rafters</p>

<p>The wavering shadows lay, And the current that came from the ocean</p>

<p>Seemed to lift and bear them away;</p>

<p>As, sweeping and eddying through them,</p>

<p>Rose the belated tide, And, streaming into the moonlight,</p>

<p>The seaweed floated wide.</p>

<p>And like those waters rushing</p>

<p>Among the wooden piers, A flood of thoughts came o'er me</p>

<p>That filled my eyes with tears.</p>

<p>How often, oh how often,</p>

<p>In the days that had gone by, I had stood on that bridge at midnight</p>

<p>And gazed on that wave and sky!</p>

<p>How often, oh how often,</p>

<p>I had wished that the ebbing tide</p>

<p>Would bear me away on its bosom O'er the ocean wild and wide!</p>

<p>For my heart was hot and restless,</p>

<p>And my life was full of care, And the burden laid upon me</p>

<p>Seemed greater than I could bear.</p>

<p>But now it has fallen from me,</p>

<p>It is buried in the sea; And only the sorrow of others</p>

<p>Throws its shadow over me,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1277</p>

<p>Yet whenever I cross the river</p>

<p>On its bridge with wooden piers, Like the odor of brine from the ocean</p>

<p>Comes the thought of other years.</p>

<p>And I think how many thousands</p>

<p>Of care-encumbered men, Each bearing his burden of sorrow,</p>

<p>Have crossed the bridge since then.</p>

<p>I see the long procession</p>

<p>Still passing to and fro, The young heart hot and restless,</p>

<p>And the old subdued and slow!</p>

<p>And forever and forever,</p>

<p>As long as the river flows, As long as the heart has passions,</p>

<p>As long as life has woes;</p>

<p>The moon and its broken reflection</p>

<p>And its shadows shall appear, As the symbol of love in heaven,</p>

<p>And its wavering image here.</p>

<p>783 Resignation</p>

<p>There is no flock, however watched and tended,</p>

<p>But one dead lamb is there! There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,</p>

<p>But has one vacant chair!</p>

<p>The air is full of farewells to the dying,</p>

<p>And mournings for the dead; The heart of Rachel, for her children crying,</p>

<p>Will not be comforted!</p>

<p>Let us be patient! These severe afflictions</p>

<p>Not from the ground arise, But oftentimes celestial benedictions</p>

<p>Assume this dark disguise.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>We see but dimly through the mists and vapors;</p>

<p>Amid these earthly damps What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers</p>

<p>May be heaven's distant lamps.</p>

<p>There is no Death! What seems so is transition;</p>

<p>This life of mortal breath Is but a suburb of the life elysian,</p>

<p>Whose portal we call Death.</p>

<p>She is not dead,the child of our affection,</p>

<p>But gone unto that school Where she no longer needs our poor protection,</p>

<p>And Christ himself doth rule.</p>

<p>In that great cloister's stillness and seclusion,</p>

<p>By guardian angels led, Safe from temptation, safe from sin's pollution,</p>

<p>She lives whom we call dead.</p>

<p>Day after day we think what she is doing</p>

<p>In those bright realms of air; Year after year, her tender steps pursuing,</p>

<p>Behold her grown more fair.</p>

<p>Thus do we walk with her, and keep unbroken,</p>

<p>The bond which nature gives, Thinking that our remembrance, though unspok<</p>

<p>May reach her where she lives.</p>

<p>Not as a child shall we again behold her;</p>

<p>For when with raptures wild In our embraces we again enfold her,</p>

<p>She will not be a child;</p>

<p>But a fair maiden, in her Father's mansion,</p>

<p>Clothed with celestial grace; And beautiful with all the soul's expansion</p>

<p>Shall we behold her face.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1279</p>

<p>And though at times impetuous with emotion</p>

<p>And anguish long suppressed, The swelling heart heaves moaning like the ocean,</p>

<p>That cannot be at rest,</p>

<p>We will be patient, and assuage the feeling</p>

<p>We may not wholly stay; By silence sanctifying, not concealing,</p>

<p>The grief that must have way.</p>

<p>J84 Children</p>

<p>Come to me, O ye children!</p>

<p>For I hear you at your play, And the questions that perplexed me</p>

<p>Have vanished quite away.</p>

<p>Ye open the eastern windows,</p>

<p>That look towards the sun, Where thoughts are singing swallows</p>

<p>And the brooks of morning run.</p>

<p>In your hearts are the birds and the sunshine, In your thoughts the brooklet's flow,</p>

<p>But in mine is the wind of Autumn And the first fall of the snow.</p>

<p>Ah! what would the world be to us</p>

<p>If the children were no more? We should dread the desert behind us</p>

<p>Worse than the dark before.</p>

<p>What the leaves are to the forest,</p>

<p>With light and air for food, Ere their sweet and tender juices</p>

<p>Have been hardened into wood,</p>

<p>That to the world are children;</p>

<p>Through them it feels the glow Of a brighter and sunnier climate</p>

<p>Than reaches the trunks below.</p>

<p>1280 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Come to me, O ye children!</p>

<p>And whisper in my ear What the birds and the winds are singing</p>

<p>In your sunny atmosphere.</p>

<p>For what are all our contrivings, And the wisdom of our books,</p>

<p>When compared with your caresses, And the gladness of your looks?</p>

<p>Ye are better than all the ballads That ever were sung or said;</p>

<p>For ye are living poems, And all the rest are dead.</p>

<p>785 The Building of the Ship</p>

<p>'Build me straight, O worthy Master!</p>

<p>Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster,</p>

<p>And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!'</p>

<p>The merchant's word</p>

<p>Delighted the Master heard;</p>

<p>For his heart was in his work, and the heart</p>

<p>Giveth grace unto every Art.</p>

<p>A quiet smile played round his lips,</p>

<p>As the eddies and dimples of the tide</p>

<p>Play round the bows of ships</p>

<p>That steadily at anchor ride.</p>

<p>And with a voice that was full of glee,</p>

<p>He answered, 'Erelong we will launch</p>

<p>A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch,</p>

<p>As ever weathered a wintry sea!'</p>

<p>And first with nicest skill and art,</p>

<p>Perfect and finished in every part,</p>

<p>A little model the Master wrought,</p>

<p>Which should be to the larger plan</p>

<p>What the child is to the man,</p>

<p>Its counterpart in miniature;</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1281</p>

<p>That with a hand more swift and sure</p>

<p>The greater labor might be brought</p>

<p>To answer to his inward thought.</p>

<p>And as he labored, his mind ran o'er</p>

<p>The various ships that were built of yore,</p>

<p>And above them all, and strangest of all</p>

<p>Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,</p>

<p>Whose picture was hanging on the wall,</p>

<p>With bows and stern raised high in air,</p>

<p>And balconies hanging here and there,</p>

<p>And signal lanterns and flags afloat,</p>

<p>And eight round towers, like those that frown</p>

<p>From some old castle, looking down</p>

<p>Upon the drawbridge and the moat.</p>

<p>And he said with a smile, 'Our ship, I wis,</p>

<p>Shall be of another form than this!'</p>

<p>It was of another form, indeed;</p>

<p>Built for freight, and yet for speed,</p>

<p>A beautiful and gallant craft;</p>

<p>Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast,</p>

<p>Pressing down upon sail and mast,</p>

<p>Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;</p>

<p>Broad in the beam, but sloping aft</p>

<p>With graceful curve and slow degrees,</p>

<p>That she might be docile to the helm,</p>

<p>And that the currents of parted seas,</p>

<p>Closing behind, with mighty force,</p>

<p>Might aid and not impede her course.</p>

<p>In the ship-yard stood the Master, With the model of the vessel, That should laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!</p>

<p>Covering many a rood of ground, Lay the timber piled around; Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak, And scattered here and there, with these, The knarred and crooked cedar knees; Brought from regions far away,</p>

<p>1282</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>From Pascagoula's sunny bay,</p>

<p>And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!</p>

<p>Ah! what a wondrous thing it is</p>

<p>To note how many wheels of toil</p>

<p>One thought, one word, can set in motion!</p>

<p>There's not a ship that sails the ocean,</p>

<p>But every climate, every soil,</p>

<p>Must bring its tribute, great or small,</p>

<p>And help to build the wooden wall!</p>

<p>The sun was rising o'er the sea, And long the level shadows lay, As if they, too, the beams would be Of some great, airy argosy, Framed and launched in a single day. That silent architect, the sun, Had hewn and laid them every one, Ere the work of man was yet begun. Beside the Master, when he spoke, A youth, against an anchor leaning, Listened, to catch his slightest meaning, Only the long waves, as they broke In ripples on the pebbly beach, Interrupted the old man's speech.</p>

<p>Beautiful they were, in sooth,</p>

<p>The old man and the fiery youth!</p>

<p>The old man, in whose busy brain</p>

<p>Many a ship that sailed the main</p>

<p>Was modelled o'er and o'er again;</p>

<p>The fiery youth, who was to be</p>

<p>The heir of his dexterity,</p>

<p>The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand</p>

<p>When he had built and launched from land</p>

<p>What the elder head had planned.</p>

<p>'Thus,' said he, 'will we build this ship! Lay square the blocks upon the slip, And follow well this plan of mine. Choose the timbers with greatest care;</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Of all that is unsound beware; For only what is sound and strong To this vessel shall belong. Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine Here together shall combine. A goodly frame, and a goodly fame, And the Union be her name! For the day that gives her to the sea Shall give my daughter unto thee!'</p>

<p>The Master's word</p>

<p>Enraptured the young man heard;</p>

<p>And as he turned his face aside,</p>

<p>With a look of joy and a thrill of pride</p>

<p>Standing before</p>

<p>Her father's door,</p>

<p>He saw the form of his promised bride.</p>

<p>The sun shone on her golden hair,</p>

<p>And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,</p>

<p>With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.</p>

<p>Like a beauteous barge was she,</p>

<p>Still at rest on the sandy beach,</p>

<p>Just beyond the billow's reach;</p>

<p>But he</p>

<p>Was the restless, seething, stormy sea! Ah, how skilful grows the hand That obeyeth Love's command! It is the heart, and not the brain, That to the highest doth attain, And he who followeth Love's behest Far excelleth all the rest!</p>

<p>Thus with the rising of the sun</p>

<p>Was the noble task begun,</p>

<p>And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds</p>

<p>Were heard the intermingled sounds</p>

<p>Of axes and of mallets, plied</p>

<p>With vigorous arms on every side;</p>

<p>Plied so defdy and so well,</p>

<p>That, ere the shadows of evening fell,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>The keel of oak for a noble ship, Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, Was lying ready, and stretched along The blocks, well placed upon the slip. Happy, thrice happy, every one Who sees his labor well begun, And not perplexed and multiplied, By idly waiting for time and tide!</p>

<p>And when the hot, long day was o'er,</p>

<p>The young man at the Master's door</p>

<p>Sat with the maiden calm and still,</p>

<p>And within the porch, a little more</p>

<p>Removed beyond the evening chill,</p>

<p>The father sat, and told them tales</p>

<p>Of wrecks in the great September gales,</p>

<p>Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main,</p>

<p>And ships that never came back again,</p>

<p>The chance and change of a sailor's life,</p>

<p>Want and plenty, rest and strife,</p>

<p>His roving fancy, like the wind,</p>

<p>That nothing can stay and nothing can bind,</p>

<p>And the magic charm of foreign lands,</p>

<p>With shadows of palms, and shining sands,</p>

<p>Where the tumbling surf,</p>

<p>O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,</p>

<p>Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,</p>

<p>As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.</p>

<p>And the trembling maiden held her breath At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, With all its terror and mystery, The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death, That divides and yet unites mankind! And whenever the old man paused, a gleam From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume The silent group in the twilight gloom, And thoughtful faces, as in a dream; And for a moment one might mark What had been hidden by the dark, That the head of the maiden lay at rest, Tenderly, on the young man's breast!</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Day by day the vessel grew,</p>

<p>With timbers fashioned strong and true,</p>

<p>Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,</p>

<p>Till, framed with perfect symmetry,</p>

<p>A skeleton ship rose up to view!</p>

<p>And around the bows and along the side</p>

<p>The heavy hammers and mallets plied,</p>

<p>Till after many a week, at length,</p>

<p>Wonderful for form and strength,</p>

<p>Sublime in its enormous bulk,</p>

<p>Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!</p>

<p>And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing,</p>

<p>Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething</p>

<p>Caldron, that glowed,</p>

<p>And overflowed</p>

<p>With the black tar, heated for the sheathing.</p>

<p>And amid the clamors</p>

<p>Of clattering hammers,</p>

<p>He who listened heard now and then</p>

<p>The song of the Master and his men:</p>

<p>'Build me straight, O worthy Master, Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,</p>

<p>That shall laugh at all disaster,</p>

<p>And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!'</p>

<p>With oaken brace and copper band,</p>

<p>Lay the rudder on the sand,</p>

<p>That, like a thought, should have control</p>

<p>Over the movement of the whole;</p>

<p>And near it the anchor, whose giant hand</p>

<p>Would reach down and grapple with the land,</p>

<p>And immovable and fast</p>

<p>Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!</p>

<p>And at the bows an image stood,</p>

<p>By a cunning artist carved in wood,</p>

<p>With robes of white, that far behind</p>

<p>Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p>It was not shaped in a classic mould,</p>

<p>Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,</p>

<p>Or Naiad rising from the water,</p>

<p>1286</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>But modelled from the Master's daughter!</p>

<p>On many a dreary and misty night,</p>

<p>'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light,</p>

<p>Speeding along through the rain and the dark,</p>

<p>Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,</p>

<p>The pilot of some phantom bark,</p>

<p>Guiding the vessel, in its flight,</p>

<p>By a path none other knows aright!</p>

<p>Behold, at last, Each tall and tapering mast Is swung into its place; Shrouds and stays Holding it firm and fast!</p>

<p>Long ago,</p>

<p>In the deer-haunted forests of Maine, When upon mountain and plain Lay the snow,</p>

<p>They fell,those lordly pines!</p>

<p>Those grand, majestic pines!</p>

<p>'Mid shouts and cheers</p>

<p>The jaded steers,</p>

<p>Panting beneath the goad,</p>

<p>Dragged down the weary, winding road</p>

<p>Those captive kings so straight and tall,</p>

<p>To be shorn of their streaming hair,</p>

<p>And naked and bare,</p>

<p>To feel the stress and the strain</p>

<p>Of the wind and the reeling main,</p>

<p>Whose roar</p>

<p>Would remind them forevermore</p>

<p>Of their native forests they should not see again.</p>

<p>And everywhere</p>

<p>The slender, graceful spars</p>

<p>Poise aloft in the air,</p>

<p>And at the mast-head,</p>

<p>White, blue, and red,</p>

<p>A flag unrolls the stripes and stars.</p>

<p>Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1287</p>

<p>In foreign harbors shall behold</p>

<p>That flag unrolled,</p>

<p>'T will be as a friendly hand</p>

<p>Stretched out from his native land,</p>

<p>Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless 1</p>

<p>All is finished! and at length</p>

<p>Has come the bridal day</p>

<p>Of beauty and of strength.</p>

<p>To-day the vessel shall be launched!</p>

<p>With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,</p>

<p>And o'er the bay,</p>

<p>Slowly, in all his splendors dight,</p>

<p>The great sun rises to behold the sight.</p>

<p>The ocean old,</p>

<p>Centuries old,</p>

<p>Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,</p>

<p>Paces restless to and fro,</p>

<p>Up and down the sands of gold.</p>

<p>His beating heart is not at rest;</p>

<p>And far and wide,</p>

<p>With ceaseless flow,</p>

<p>His beard of snow</p>

<p>Heaves with the heaving of his breast.</p>

<p>He waits impatient for his bride.</p>

<p>There she stands,</p>

<p>With her foot upon the sands,</p>

<p>Decked with flags and streamers gay,</p>

<p>In honor of her marriage day,</p>

<p>Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,</p>

<p>Round her like a veil descending,</p>

<p>Ready to be</p>

<p>The bride of the gray old sea.</p>

<p>On the deck another bride Is standing by her lover's side. Shadows from the flags and shrouds, Like the shadows cast by clouds, Broken by many a sudden fleck, Fall around them on the deck.</p>

<p>1288</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>The prayer is said, The service read,</p>

<p>The joyous bridegroom bows his head; And in tears the good old Master Shakes the brown hand of his son, Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek In silence, for he cannot speak, And ever fister</p>

<p>Down his own the tears begin to run.</p>

<p>The worthy pastor</p>

<p>The shepherd of that wandering flock,</p>

<p>That has the ocean for its wold,</p>

<p>That has the vessel for its fold,</p>

<p>Leaping ever from rock to rock</p>

<p>Spake, with accents mild and clear,</p>

<p>Words of warning, words of cheer,</p>

<p>But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.</p>

<p>He knew the chart</p>

<p>Of the sailor's heart,</p>

<p>All its pleasures and its griefs,</p>

<p>All its shallows and rocky reefs,</p>

<p>All those secret currents, that flow</p>

<p>With such resistless undertow,</p>

<p>And lift and drift, with terrible force,</p>

<p>The will from its moorings and its course.</p>

<p>Therefore he spake, and thus said he:</p>

<p>'Like unto ships far off at sea,</p>

<p>Outward or homeward bound, are we.</p>

<p>Before, behind, and all around,</p>

<p>Floats and swings the horizon's bound,</p>

<p>Seems at its distant rim to rise</p>

<p>And climb the crystal wall of the skies,</p>

<p>And then again to turn and sink,</p>

<p>As if we could slide from its outer brink.</p>

<p>Ah! it is not the sea,</p>

<p>It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,</p>

<p>But ourselves</p>

<p>That rock and rise</p>

<p>With endless and uneasy motion,</p>

<p>Now touching the very skies,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Now sinking into the depths of ocean. Ah! if our souls but poise and swing Like the compass in its brazen ring, Ever level and ever true To the toil and the task we have to do, We shall sail securely, and safely reach The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach The sights we see, and the sounds we hear, Will be those of joy and not of fear!'</p>

<p>Then the Master,</p>

<p>With a gesture of command,</p>

<p>Waved his hand;</p>

<p>And at the word,</p>

<p>Loud and sudden there was heard,</p>

<p>All around them and below,</p>

<p>The sound of hammers, blow on blow,</p>

<p>Knocking away the shores and spurs.</p>

<p>And see! she stirs!</p>

<p>She starts,she moves,she seems to feel The thrill of life along her keel, And, spurning with her foot the ground, With one exulting, joyous bound, She leaps into the ocean's arms! And lo! from the assembled crowd There rose a shout, prolonged and loud, That to the ocean seemed to say, 'Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray, Take her to thy protecting arms, With all her youth and all her charms!'</p>

<p>How beautiful she is! How fair</p>

<p>She lies within those arms, that press</p>

<p>Her form with many a soft caress</p>

<p>Of tenderness and watchful care!</p>

<p>Sail forth into the sea, O ship!</p>

<p>Through wind and wave, right onward steer!</p>

<p>The moistened eye, the trembling lip,</p>

<p>Are not the signs of doubt or fear.</p>

<p>I29O HENRY WADSWORTH LONG FELLOW</p>

<p>Sail forth into the sea of life, O gentle, loving, trusting wife, And safe from all adversity Upon the bosom of that sea Thy comings and thy goings be! For gentleness and love and trust Prevail o'er angry wave and gust; And in the wreck of noble lives Something immortal still survives!</p>

<p>Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!</p>

<p>Sail on, O Union, strong and great!</p>

<p>Humanity with all its fears,</p>

<p>With all the hopes of future years,</p>

<p>Is hanging breathless on thy fate!</p>

<p>We know what Master laid thy keel,</p>

<p>What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,</p>

<p>Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,</p>

<p>What anvils rang, what hammers beat,</p>

<p>In what a forge and what a heat</p>

<p>Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!</p>

<p>Fear not each sudden sound and shock,</p>

<p>'Tis of the wave and not the rock;</p>

<p>'Tis but the flapping of the sail,</p>

<p>And not a rent made by the gale!</p>

<p>In spite of rock and tempest's roar,</p>

<p>In spite of false lights on the shore,</p>

<p>Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!</p>

<p>Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,</p>

<p>Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,</p>

<p>Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,</p>

<p>Are all with thee,are all with thee!</p>

<p>786 My Lost Youth</p>

<p>Often I think of the beautiful town</p>

<p>That is seated by the sea; Often in thought go up and down The pleasant streets of that dear old town,</p>

<p>And my youth comes back to me.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1291</p>

<p>And a verse of a Lapland song Is haunting my memory still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>I can see the shadowy lines of its trees,</p>

<p>And catch, in sudden gleams, The sheen of the far-surrounding seas, And islands that were the Hesperides Of all my boyish dreams.</p>

<p>And the burden of that old song, It murmurs and whispers still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>I remember the black wharves and the slips,</p>

<p>And the sea-tides tossing free; And the Spanish sailors with bearded lips, And the beauty and mystery of the ships, And the magic of the sea.</p>

<p>And the voice of that wayward song Is singing and saying still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>I remember the bulwarks by the shore,</p>

<p>And the fort upon the hill; The sunrise gun, with its hollow roar, The drum-beat repeated o'er and o'er, And the bugle wild and shrill. And the music of that old song Throbs in my memory still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>I remember the sea-fight far away,</p>

<p>How it thundered o'er the tide! And the dead captains, as they lay In their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay</p>

<p>Where they in battle died.</p>

<p>1292 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>And the sound of that mournful song Goes through me with a thrill: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>I can see the breezy dome of groves, The shadows of Deering's Woods; And the friendships old and the early loves Come back with a Sabbath sound, as of doves In quiet neighborhoods.</p>

<p>And the verse of that sweet old song, It flutters and murmurs still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>I remember the gleams and glooms that dart</p>

<p>Across the school-boy's brain; The song and the silence in the heart, That in part are prophecies, and in part Are longings wild and vain. And the voice of that fitful song Sings on, and is never still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>There are things of which I may not speak;</p>

<p>There are dreams that cannot die; There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak, And bring a pallor into the cheek, And a mist before the eye. And the words of that fatal song Come over me like a chill: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</p>

<p>Strange to me now are the forms I meet</p>

<p>When I visit the dear old town; But the native air is pure and sweet, And the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street,</p>

<p>As they balance up and down,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Are singing the beautiful song, Are sighing and whispering still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts</p>

<p>And Deering's Woods are fresh and fair,</p>

<p>And with joy that is almost pain My heart goes back to wander there, And among the dreams of the days that were, I find my lost youth again.</p>

<p>And the strange and beautiful song, The groves are repeating it still: 'A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts</p>

<p>The Fiftieth Birthday of Agassiz May 28, 1857</p>

<p>It was fifty years ago</p>

<p>In the pleasant month of May, In the beautiful Pays de Vaud,</p>

<p>A child in its cradle lay.</p>

<p>And Nature, the old nurse, took</p>

<p>The child upon her knee, Saying: 'Here is a story-book</p>

<p>Thy Father has written for thee.'</p>

<p>'Come, wander with me,' she said,</p>

<p>'Into regions yet untrod; And read what is still unread</p>

<p>In the manuscripts of God.'</p>

<p>And he wandered away and away With Nature, the dear old nurse,</p>

<p>Who sang to him night and day The rhymes of the universe.</p>

<p>And whenever the way seemed long,</p>

<p>Or his heart began to fail, She would sing a more wonderful song,</p>

<p>Or tell a more marvellous tale.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>So she keeps him still a child,</p>

<p>And will not let him go, Though at times his heart beats wild</p>

<p>For the beautiful Pays de Vaud;</p>

<p>Though at times he hears in his dreams The Ranz des Vaches of old,</p>

<p>And the rush of mountain streams From glaciers clear and cold;</p>

<p>And the mother at home says, 'Hark!</p>

<p>For his voice I listen and yearn; It is growing late and dark,</p>

<p>And my boy does not return!'</p>

<p>The Children's Hour Between the dark and the daylight,</p>

<p>When the night is beginning to lower, Comes a pause in the day's occupations,</p>

<p>That is known as the Children's Hour.</p>

<p>I hear in the chamber above me</p>

<p>The patter of little feet, The sound of a door that is opened,</p>

<p>And voices soft and sweet.</p>

<p>From my study I see in the lamplight, Descending the broad hall stair,</p>

<p>Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, And Edith with golden hair.</p>

<p>A whisper, and then a silence: Yet I know by their merry eyes</p>

<p>They are plotting and planning together To take me by surprise.</p>

<p>A sudden rush from the stairway, A sudden raid from the hall!</p>

<p>By three doors left unguarded They enter my castle wall!</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>They climb up into my turret</p>

<p>O'er the arms and back of my chair;</p>

<p>If I try to escape, they surround me; They seem to be everywhere.</p>

<p>They almost devour me with kisses, Their arms about me entwine,</p>

<p>Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine I</p>

<p>Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti, Because you have scaled the wall,</p>

<p>Such an old mustache as I am Is not a match for you all!</p>

<p>I have you fast in my fortress, And will not let you depart,</p>

<p>But put you down into the dungeon In the round-tower of my heart.</p>

<p>And there will I keep you forever,</p>

<p>Yes, forever and a day, Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,</p>

<p>And moulder in dust away!</p>

<p>y8g Paul Revere's Ride</p>

<p>Listen, my children, and you shall hear</p>

<p>Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;</p>

<p>Hardly a man is now alive</p>

<p>Who remembers that famous day and year.</p>

<p>He said to his friend, 'If the British march</p>

<p>By land or sea from the town to-night,</p>

<p>Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</p>

<p>Of the North Church tower as a signal light,</p>

<p>One, if by land, and two, if by sea;</p>

<p>And I on the opposite shore will be,</p>

<p>Ready to ride and spread the alarm</p>

<p>Through every Middlesex village and farm,</p>

<p>For the country folk to be up and to arm.'</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Then he said, 'Good-night!' and with muffled oar</p>

<p>Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,</p>

<p>Just as the moon rose over the bay,</p>

<p>Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</p>

<p>The Somerset, British man-of-war;</p>

<p>A phantom ship, with each mast and spar</p>

<p>Across the moon like a prison bar,</p>

<p>And a huge black hulk, that was magnified</p>

<p>By its own reflection in the tide.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street, Wanders and watches with eager ears, Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door, The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, And the measured tread of the grenadiers, Marching down to their boats on the shore.</p>

<p>Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,</p>

<p>By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,</p>

<p>To the belfry-chamber overhead,</p>

<p>And startled the pigeons from their perch</p>

<p>On the sombre rafters, that round him made</p>

<p>Masses and moving shapes of shade,</p>

<p>By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,</p>

<p>To the highest window in the wall,</p>

<p>Where he paused to listen and look down</p>

<p>A moment on the roofs of the town,</p>

<p>And the moonlight flowing over all.</p>

<p>Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,</p>

<p>In their night-encampment on the hill,</p>

<p>Wrapped in silence so deep and still</p>

<p>That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,</p>

<p>The watchful night-wind, as it went</p>

<p>Creeping along from tent to tent,</p>

<p>And seeming to whisper, 'AH is well!'</p>

<p>A moment only he feels the spell</p>

<p>Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread</p>

<p>Of the lonely belfry and the dead;</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away, Where the river widens to meet the bay, A line of black that bends and floats On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. Now he patted his horse's side, Now gazed at the landscape far and near, Then, impetuous, stamped the earth, And turned and tightened his saddle-girth; But mostly he watched with eager search The belfry-tower of the Old North Church, As it rose above the graves on the hill, Lonely and spectral and sombre and still. And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height A glimmer, and then a gleam of light! He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight A second lamp in the belfry burns!</p>

<p>A hurry of hoofs in a village street,</p>

<p>A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,</p>

<p>And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark</p>

<p>Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;</p>

<p>That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,</p>

<p>The fate of a nation was riding that night;</p>

<p>And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,</p>

<p>Kindled the land into flame with its heat.</p>

<p>He has left the village and mounted the steep, And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep, Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides; And under the alders that skirt its edge, Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge, Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.</p>

<p>It was twelve by the village clock,</p>

<p>When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.</p>

<p>He heard the crowing of the cock,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>And the barking of the farmer's dog, And felt the damp of the river fog, That rises after the sun goes down.</p>

<p>It was one by the village clock,</p>

<p>When he galloped into Lexington.</p>

<p>He saw the gilded weathercock</p>

<p>Swim in the moonlight as he passed,</p>

<p>And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,</p>

<p>Gaze at him with a spectral glare,</p>

<p>As if they already stood aghast</p>

<p>At the bloody work they would look upon.</p>

<p>It was two by the village clock,</p>

<p>When he came to the bridge in Concord town.</p>

<p>He heard the bleating of the flock,</p>

<p>And the twitter of birds among the trees,</p>

<p>And felt the breath of the morning breeze</p>

<p>Blowing over the meadows brown.</p>

<p>And one was safe and asleep in his bed</p>

<p>Who at the bridge would be first to fall,</p>

<p>Who that day would be lying dead,</p>

<p>Pierced by a British musket-ball.</p>

<p>You know the rest. In the books you have read, How the British Regulars fired and fled, How the farmers gave them ball for ball, From behind each fence and farm-yard wall, Chasing the red-coats down the lane, Then crossing the fields to emerge again Under the trees at the turn of the road, And only pausing to fire and load.</p>

<p>So through the night rode Paul Revere;</p>

<p>And so through the night went his cry of alarm</p>

<p>To every Middlesex village and farm,</p>

<p>A cry of defiance and not of fear,</p>

<p>A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door</p>

<p>And a word that shall echo forevermore!</p>

<p>For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1299</p>

<p>Through all our history, to the last, In the hour of darkness and peril and need, The people will waken and listen to hear The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed, And the midnight message of Paul Revere.</p>

<p>790 Killed at the Ford</p>

<p>He is dead, the beautiful youth, The heart of honor, the tongue of truth, He, the life and light of us all, Whose voice was blithe as a bugle-call, Whom all eyes followed with one consent, The cheer of whose laugh, and whose pleasant word, Hushed all murmurs of discontent.</p>

<p>Only last night, as we rode along,</p>

<p>Down the dark of the mountain gap,</p>

<p>To visit the picket-guard at the ford,</p>

<p>Litde dreaming of any mishap,</p>

<p>He was humming the words of some old song:</p>

<p>'Two red roses he had on his cap</p>

<p>And another he bore at the point of his sword.'</p>

<p>Sudden and swift a whistling ball Came out of a wood, and the voice was still; Something I heard in the darkness fall, And for a moment my blood grew chill; I spake in a whisper, as he who speaks In a room where some one is lying dead; But he made no answer to what I said.</p>

<p>We lifted him up to his saddle again,</p>

<p>And through the mire and the mist and the rain</p>

<p>Carried him back to the silent camp,</p>

<p>And laid him as if asleep on his bed;</p>

<p>And I saw by the light of the surgeon's lamp</p>

<p>Two white roses upon his cheeks,</p>

<p>And one, just over his heart, blood-red!</p>

<p>And I saw in a vision how far and fleet That fatal bullet went speeding forth, Till it reached a town in the distant North,</p>

<p>1300 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Till it reached a house in a sunny street,</p>

<p>Till it reached a heart that ceased to beat,</p>

<p>Without a murmur, without a cry;</p>

<p>And a bell was tolled, in that far-off town,</p>

<p>For one who had passed from cross to crown</p>

<p>And the neighbors wondered that she should die.</p>

<p>797 Evangeline</p>

<p>a tale of acadie</p>

<p>This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks, Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight, Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic, Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms. Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.</p>

<p>This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman?</p>

<p>Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers, Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands, Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven? Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed! Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty blasts of October Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean. Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of Grand-Pre.</p>

<p>Ye who believe in affection that hopes, and endures, and is patient, Ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion, List to the mournful tradition, still sung by the pines of the forest; List to a Tale of Love in Acadie, home of the happy.</p>

<p>Part the First 1</p>

<p>In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas, Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pre Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the eastward, Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number. Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I3OI</p>

<p>Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows. West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended. There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village. Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock, Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries. Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway. There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset Lighted the village street, and gilded the vanes on the chimneys, Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors Mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens.</p>

<p>Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them. Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens, Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome. Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon from the belfry Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending, Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment. Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers, Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics. Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows; But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners; There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.</p>

<p>Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas, Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre, Dwelt on his goodly acres; and with him, directing his household, Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village. Stalwart and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;</p>

<p>1302 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snowflakes; White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves.</p>

<p>Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers. Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside, Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!</p>

<p>Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows. When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden. Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them, Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal, Wearing her Norman cap, and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings, Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom, Handed down from mother to child, through long generations. But a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession, Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her. When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.</p>

<p>Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it. Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow. Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse, Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside, Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary. Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses. Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farmyard.</p>

<p>There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows;</p>

<p>There were the folds for the sheep; and there, in his feathered seraglio, Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter. Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In each one</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I303</p>

<p>Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase, Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous cornloft. There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.</p>

<p>Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pre Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household. Many a youth, as he knelt in church and opened his missal, Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion; Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment! Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended, And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps, Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron; Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village, Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music. But, among all who came, young Gabriel only was welcome; Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith, Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men; For, since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations, Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people. Basil was Benedict's friend. Their children from earliest childhood Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician, Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters Out of the self-same book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song.</p>

<p>But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,</p>

<p>Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.</p>

<p>There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him</p>

<p>Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,</p>

<p>Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel</p>

<p>Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders.</p>

<p>Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness</p>

<p>Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,</p>

<p>Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,</p>

<p>And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,</p>

<p>Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel.</p>

<p>Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,</p>

<p>Down the hillside bounding, they glided away o'er the meadow.</p>

<p>I304 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters, Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings; Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow! Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children. He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning, Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action. She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman. 'Sunshine of Saint Eulalie' was she called; for that was the sunshine Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples; She, too, would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance, Filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,</p>

<p>And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.</p>

<p>Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,</p>

<p>Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands.</p>

<p>Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September</p>

<p>Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel.</p>

<p>All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.</p>

<p>Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey</p>

<p>Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian hunters asserted</p>

<p>Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.</p>

<p>Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,</p>

<p>Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!</p>

<p>Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape</p>

<p>Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.</p>

<p>Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean</p>

<p>Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in harmony blended.</p>

<p>Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,</p>

<p>Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,</p>

<p>All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun</p>

<p>Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;</p>

<p>While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,</p>

<p>Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest</p>

<p>Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels.1</p>

<p>Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness. Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending 1 Evelyn's Silva, ii, 53. (Longfellow).</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I305</p>

<p>Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead. Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other, And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening. Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer, Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar, Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection. Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside, Where was their favorite pasture. Behind them followed the watch-dog, Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct, Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers; Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector, When from the forest at night, through the starry silence the wolves howled.</p>

<p>Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,</p>

<p>Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor.</p>

<p>Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,</p>

<p>While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,</p>

<p>Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,</p>

<p>Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.</p>

<p>Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders</p>

<p>Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence</p>

<p>Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.</p>

<p>Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,</p>

<p>Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;</p>

<p>Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,</p>

<p>Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.</p>

<p>In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer Sat in his elbow-chair and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths</p>

<p>Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him, Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic, Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness. Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair Laughed in the flickering light; and the pewter plates on the dresser Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine. Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas, Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.</p>

<p>I306 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated, Spinning flax for the loom, that stood in the corner behind her. Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle, While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe, Followed the old man's song and united the fragments together. As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases, Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar, So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.</p>

<p>Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted, Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges. Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith, And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him. 'Welcome!' the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold,</p>

<p>'Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle</p>

<p>Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;</p>

<p>Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;</p>

<p>Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling</p>

<p>Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams</p>

<p>Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes.'</p>

<p>Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,</p>

<p>Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:</p>

<p>'Benedict Beliefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!</p>

<p>Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with</p>

<p>Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.</p>

<p>Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe.'</p>

<p>Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,</p>

<p>And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:</p>

<p>'Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors</p>

<p>Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.</p>

<p>What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded</p>

<p>On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate</p>

<p>Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the mean time</p>

<p>Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people.'</p>

<p>Then made answer the farmer: 'Perhaps some friendlier purpose</p>

<p>Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England</p>

<p>By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,</p>

<p>And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children.'</p>

<p>'Not so thinketh the folk in the village,' said, warmly, the blacksmith,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I307</p>

<p>Shaking his head, as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued: 'Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal. Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts, Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow. Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds; Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower.' Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer: 'Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields, Safer within these peaceful dikes, besieged by the ocean, Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon. Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow Fall on this house and earth; for this is the night of the contract. Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,</p>

<p>Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth. Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and ink-horn. Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?' As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's, Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken, And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.</p>

<p>in</p>

<p>Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,</p>

<p>Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;</p>

<p>Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung</p>

<p>Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows</p>

<p>Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.</p>

<p>Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred</p>

<p>Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.</p>

<p>Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,</p>

<p>Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.</p>

<p>Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,</p>

<p>Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike.</p>

<p>He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;</p>

<p>For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,</p>

<p>And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,</p>

<p>And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened</p>

<p>Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;</p>

<p>And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,</p>

<p>I308 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell, And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes, With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village. Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith, Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand, 'Father Leblanc,' he exclaimed, 'thou hast heard the talk in the village, And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand.' Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public, 'Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser; And what their errand may be I know not better than others. Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?' 'God's name!' shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith; 'Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?</p>

<p>Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!' But without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public, 'Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me, When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal.' This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them. 'Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember, Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand, And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people. Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance, Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them. But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted; Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty</p>

<p>Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace That a necklace of pearls was lost, and erelong a suspicion Fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household. She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold, Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice. As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended, Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I309</p>

<p>Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance, And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie, Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven.' Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language; All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.</p>

<p>Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table, Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre;</p>

<p>While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink-horn, Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties, Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle. Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed, And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin. Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver; And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and the bridegroom, Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare. Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed, While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside, Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner. Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuvre, Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row.</p>

<p>Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure, Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise Over the pallid sea, and the silvery mists of the meadows. Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.</p>

<p>Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household. Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness. Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,</p>

<p>1310 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer. Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed. Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness, Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden. Silent she passed the hall, and entered the door of her chamber. Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven. This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage, Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife. Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden</p>

<p>Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.</p>

<p>Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with</p>

<p>Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!</p>

<p>Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,</p>

<p>Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.</p>

<p>Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness</p>

<p>Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight</p>

<p>Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.</p>

<p>And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass</p>

<p>Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,</p>

<p>As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar!</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>Pleasandy rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre. Pleasandy gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas, Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor. Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning. Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets, Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants. Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows, Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward, Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway. Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced. Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors</p>

<p>Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I3II</p>

<p>Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted; For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together, All things were held in common, and what one had was another's. Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant: For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father; Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it.</p>

<p>Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard, Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal. There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated; There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith. Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider-press and the beehives, Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats.</p>

<p>Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers. Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle, Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres, and Le Carillon de Dunquerque, And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music. Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows; Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them. Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter! Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!</p>

<p>So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat. Thronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard, Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones</p>

<p>Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest. Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them</p>

<p>Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement, Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers. Then uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar, Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.</p>

<p>1312 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>'You are convened this day,' he said, 'by his Majesty's orders. Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness, Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous. Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch; Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people! Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty's pleasure!' As, when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer, Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones Beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows, Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,</p>

<p>Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;</p>

<p>So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.</p>

<p>Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose</p>

<p>Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,</p>

<p>And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the doorway.</p>

<p>Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations</p>

<p>Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others</p>

<p>Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,</p>

<p>As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.</p>

<p>Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted, 'Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!</p>

<p>Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests! '</p>

<p>More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.</p>

<p>In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention, Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar. Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people; Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes. 'What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you? Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I313</p>

<p>Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another! Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations? Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness? This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred? Lo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you! See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion! Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, "O Father, forgive them!" Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us, Let us repeat it now, and say, "O Father, forgive them!" ' Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak, While they repeated his prayer, and said, 'O Father, forgive them!'</p>

<p>Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar. Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest, and the people responded, Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,</p>

<p>Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.</p>

<p>Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children. Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending, Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows. Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table; There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers; There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy,</p>

<p>And, at the head of the board, the great arm-chair of the farmer. Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows. Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen, And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended, Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience! Then, all-forgetful of self, she wandered into the village, Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women, As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed, Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.</p>

<p>1314 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai. Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered. All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows Stood she, and listened and looked, till, overcome by emotion, 'Gabriel!' cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living. Slowly at length she returned to the tenandess house of her father. Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted, Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror. Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber. In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window. Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder Told her that God was in heaven, and governed the world He created! Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven; Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse. Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession, Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women, Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore, Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings, Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland. Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen, While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.</p>

<p>Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach</p>

<p>Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants. All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply; All day long the wains came laboring down from the village. Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting, Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard. Thither the women and children thronged. On a sudden the church-doors</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I315</p>

<p>Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers. Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country, Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn, So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters. Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices, Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions: 'Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain! Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!' Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside</p>

<p>Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.</p>

<p>Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence, Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction, Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her, And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion. Tears then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him, Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,</p>

<p>'Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!' Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father Saw she slowly advancing. Alas! how changed was his aspect! Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep</p>

<p>Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom. But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him, Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not. Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.</p>

<p>There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking. Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children</p>

<p>Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.</p>

<p>So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,</p>

<p>While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.</p>

<p>I316 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight</p>

<p>Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean</p>

<p>Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach</p>

<p>Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.</p>

<p>Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,</p>

<p>Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,</p>

<p>All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,</p>

<p>Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.</p>

<p>Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,</p>

<p>Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving</p>

<p>Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.</p>

<p>Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures;</p>

<p>Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders;</p>

<p>Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,</p>

<p>Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk-maid.</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,</p>

<p>Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows.</p>

<p>But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled, Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest. Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered, Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children. Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish, Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering, Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore. Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father, And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man, Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion, E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken. Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him, Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not, But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering firelight. 'BenediciteV murmured the priest, in tones of compassion. More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold, Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow. Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden, Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals. Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I317</p>

<p>Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon the mountain and meadow, Seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together. Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village, Gleamed on the sky and sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead. Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.</p>

<p>Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,</p>

<p>Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.</p>

<p>These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.</p>

<p>Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish, 'We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre!' Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards, Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted. Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments Far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the Nebraska, When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,</p>

<p>Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river. Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them: And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion, Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the sea-shore Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed. Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror. Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom. Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber; And when she awoke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her.</p>

<p>1318 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her, Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion. Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape, Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her, And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses. Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people, 'Let us bury him here by the sea. When a happier season Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile, Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the church-yard.' Such were the words of the priest. And there in haste by the sea-side, Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches, But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pre. And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow, Lo! with a mournful sound, like the voice of a vast congregation, Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges. 'Twas the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean, With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward. Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking; And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor, Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.</p>

<p>Part the Second i</p>

<p>Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pr^, When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed, Bearing a nation, with all its household gods, into exile, Exile without an end, and without an example in story. Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed; Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast</p>

<p>Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland. Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city, From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas, From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean, Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth. Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken, Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside. Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I319</p>

<p>Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered, Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things. Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended, Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her, Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned, As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert is marked by Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine. Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished; As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine, Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly descended Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen. Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her, Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit, She would commence again her endless search and endeavor; Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,</p>

<p>Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him. Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper, Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward. Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,</p>

<p>But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten.</p>

<p>'Gabriel Lajeunesse!' they said; 'Oh yes! we have seen him.</p>

<p>He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have gone to the prairies;</p>

<p>Coureurs-des-Bois are they, and famous hunters and trappers.'</p>

<p>'Gabriel Lajeunesse!' said others; 'Oh yes! we have seen him.</p>

<p>He is a Voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana.'</p>

<p>Then would they say, 'Dear child! why dream and wait for him longer?</p>

<p>Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel ? others</p>

<p>Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits as loyal?</p>

<p>Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary's son, who has loved thee</p>

<p>Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand and be happy!</p>

<p>Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine's tresses.'1</p>

<p>Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but sadly, 'I cannot!</p>

<p>Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere.</p>

<p>For when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway,</p>

<p>1 There is a common expression in French, 'coiffer Sainte Catherine,' meaning to be an old maid.</p>

<p>1320 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Many things are made clear, that else lie hidden in darkness.' Thereupon the priest, her friend and father-confessor, Said, with a smile, 'O daughter! thy God thus speaketh within thee! Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted; If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning Back to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment; That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain. Patience; accomplish thy.labor; accomplish thy work of affection! ' Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike. Therefore accomplish thy labor of love, till the heart is made godlike, Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered more worthy of heaven!' Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline labored and waited. Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean, But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered, 'Despair not!'</p>

<p>Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort, Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and thorns of existence. Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer's footsteps; Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence, But as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley: Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only; Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it, Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur; Happy, at length, if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet.</p>

<p>11</p>

<p>It was the month of May. Far down the Beautiful River,</p>

<p>Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash,</p>

<p>Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi,</p>

<p>Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen.</p>

<p>It was a band of exiles: a raft, as it were, from the shipwrecked</p>

<p>Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,</p>

<p>Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;</p>

<p>Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,</p>

<p>Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers</p>

<p>On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.</p>

<p>With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.</p>

<p>Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,</p>

<p>Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river;</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1321</p>

<p>Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders. Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current, Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin, Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded. Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river, Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of luxuriant gardens, Stood the houses of planters, with negro-cabins and dove-cots. They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer, Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron, Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward. They, too, swerved from their course; and entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,</p>

<p>Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,</p>

<p>Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.</p>

<p>Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress</p>

<p>Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air</p>

<p>Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.</p>

<p>Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons</p>

<p>Home to their roosts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,</p>

<p>Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.</p>

<p>Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,</p>

<p>Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,</p>

<p>Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.</p>

<p>Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;</p>

<p>And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,</p>

<p>Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.</p>

<p>As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,</p>

<p>Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,</p>

<p>So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,</p>

<p>Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.</p>

<p>But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faindy</p>

<p>Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.</p>

<p>It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.</p>

<p>Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,</p>

<p>And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Then in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen, And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure</p>

<p>1322 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.</p>

<p>Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,</p>

<p>Breaking the seal of silence, and giving tongues to the forest.</p>

<p>Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.</p>

<p>Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,</p>

<p>Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;</p>

<p>But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;</p>

<p>And, when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.</p>

<p>Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,</p>

<p>Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,</p>

<p>Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers,</p>

<p>While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,</p>

<p>Far off,indistinct,as of wave or wind in the forest,</p>

<p>Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.</p>

<p>Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya. Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen. Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms, And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands, Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses, Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber. Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended. Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin, Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward, Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered. Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar. Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob, On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending, Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom. Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it. Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.</p>

<p>Nearer, and ever nearer, among the numberless islands, Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er the water, Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I323</p>

<p>Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver.</p>

<p>At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn.</p>

<p>Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness</p>

<p>Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.</p>

<p>Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and resdess,</p>

<p>Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.</p>

<p>Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,</p>

<p>But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos,</p>

<p>So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows;</p>

<p>All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen, were the sleepers.</p>

<p>Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.</p>

<p>Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.</p>

<p>After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,</p>

<p>As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden</p>

<p>Said with a sigh to the friendly priest, 'O Father Felician!</p>

<p>Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.</p>

<p>Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?</p>

<p>Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?'</p>

<p>Then, with a blush, she added, 'Alas for my credulous fancy!</p>

<p>Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning.'</p>

<p>But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,</p>

<p>'Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning.</p>

<p>Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface</p>

<p>Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.</p>

<p>Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.</p>

<p>Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the southward,</p>

<p>On the banks of the Teche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.</p>

<p>There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,</p>

<p>There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.</p>

<p>Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;</p>

<p>Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens</p>

<p>Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.</p>

<p>They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana!'</p>

<p>With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey. Sofdy the evening came. The sun from the western horizon Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape; Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together. Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,</p>

<p>I324 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.</p>

<p>Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.</p>

<p>Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling</p>

<p>Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.</p>

<p>Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,</p>

<p>Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,</p>

<p>Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,</p>

<p>That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.</p>

<p>Plaintive at first were the tones and sad: then soaring to madness</p>

<p>Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.</p>

<p>Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation; Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision, As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches. With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion, Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,</p>

<p>And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,</p>

<p>Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;</p>

<p>Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.</p>

<p>in</p>

<p>Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks, from whose branches Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted, Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yuletide, Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman. A garden Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms, Filling the air with fragrance. The house itself was of timbers Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together. Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported, Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda, Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it. At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden, Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol, Scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals. Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow, And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I325</p>

<p>In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway</p>

<p>Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,</p>

<p>Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.</p>

<p>Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas</p>

<p>Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,</p>

<p>Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grape-vines.</p>

<p>Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie, Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups, Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin. Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master. Round about him were numberless herds of kine, that were grazing Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape. Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening. Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean. Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie, And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance. Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden</p>

<p>Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him. Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder; When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith. Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden. There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces, Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful. Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed, Broke the silence and said, 'If you came by the Atchafalaya, How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?' Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed. Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent, 'Gone? is Gabriel gone?' and, concealing her face on his shoulder, All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.</p>

<p>1326 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Then the good Basil said,and his voice grew blithe as he said it,</p>

<p>'Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.</p>

<p>Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.</p>

<p>Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit</p>

<p>Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence,</p>

<p>Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,</p>

<p>Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,</p>

<p>He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,</p>

<p>Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him</p>

<p>Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,</p>

<p>Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.</p>

<p>Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;</p>

<p>He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.</p>

<p>Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning</p>

<p>We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison.'</p>

<p>Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river, Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler. Long under Basil's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus, Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals. Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle. 'Long live Michael,' they cried, 'our brave Acadian minstrel!' As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured, Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips, Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters. Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci-devant blacksmith, All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor; Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate, And of the prairies, whose numberless herds were his who would take them;</p>

<p>Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise. Thus they ascended the steps, and crossing the breezy veranda, Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.</p>

<p>Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended. All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver, Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1327</p>

<p>Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.</p>

<p>Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion. Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco, Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened: 'Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,</p>

<p>Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one! Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers; Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer. Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.</p>

<p>All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer. Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies; Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses. After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests, No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads, Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle.'</p>

<p>Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,</p>

<p>While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,</p>

<p>So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,</p>

<p>Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils.</p>

<p>But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:</p>

<p>'Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!</p>

<p>For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,</p>

<p>Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!'</p>

<p>Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching</p>

<p>Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.</p>

<p>It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,</p>

<p>Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman.</p>

<p>Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:</p>

<p>Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,</p>

<p>Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,</p>

<p>Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.</p>

<p>But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding</p>

<p>From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,</p>

<p>I328 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Broke up all further speech. Away, like children delighted, All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening Whirl of the giddy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music, Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman Sat, conversing together of past and present and future; While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden. Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest, Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,</p>

<p>Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit. Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian. Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,</p>

<p>Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical moonlight</p>

<p>Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,</p>

<p>As, through the garden-gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,</p>

<p>Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.</p>

<p>Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies</p>

<p>Gleamed and floated away in mingled and infinite numbers.</p>

<p>Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,</p>

<p>Shone on the eyes of man, who had ceased to marvel and worship,</p>

<p>Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,</p>

<p>As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, 'Upharsin.'</p>

<p>And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,</p>

<p>Wandered alone, and she cried, 'O Gabriel! O my beloved!</p>

<p>Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?</p>

<p>Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?</p>

<p>Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!</p>

<p>Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!</p>

<p>Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,</p>

<p>Thou hast lain down to rest, and to dream of me in thy slumbers!</p>

<p>When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?'</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW I329</p>

<p>Loud and sudden and near the notes of a whippoorwill sounded Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets, Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence. 'Patience!' whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness: And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, 'To-morrow!'</p>

<p>Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal. 'Farewell!' said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold; 'See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine, And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming.'</p>

<p>'Farewell!' answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended</p>

<p>Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.</p>

<p>Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,</p>

<p>Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,</p>

<p>Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.</p>

<p>Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,</p>

<p>Found they the trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,</p>

<p>Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain</p>

<p>Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country;</p>

<p>Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,</p>

<p>Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord,</p>

<p>That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,</p>

<p>Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.</p>

<p>iv</p>

<p>Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits. Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway, Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon, Westward the Oregon flows and the Walkway and Owyhee. Eastward,with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains, Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska; And to the south, from Fontaine-qui-bout and the Spanish sierras, Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert, Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean, Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations. Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies;</p>

<p>1330 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,</p>

<p>Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.</p>

<p>Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk and the roebuck;</p>

<p>Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;</p>

<p>Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;</p>

<p>Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,</p>

<p>Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails.</p>

<p>Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,</p>

<p>Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,</p>

<p>By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.</p>

<p>Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;</p>

<p>Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;</p>

<p>And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,</p>

<p>Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,</p>

<p>And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,</p>

<p>Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.</p>

<p>Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains, Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him. Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him. Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall, When they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes. And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary, Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.</p>

<p>Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered Into their little camp an Indian woman, whose features Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow. She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people, From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches, Where her Canadian husband, a Coureur-des-Bois, had been murdered. Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome</p>

<p>Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers. But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions, Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1331</p>

<p>Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering firelight</p>

<p>Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,</p>

<p>Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated</p>

<p>Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,</p>

<p>All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.</p>

<p>Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another</p>

<p>Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.</p>

<p>Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,</p>

<p>Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,</p>

<p>She in turn related her love and all its disasters.</p>

<p>Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended</p>

<p>Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror</p>

<p>Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mow is;</p>

<p>Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden,</p>

<p>But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,</p>

<p>Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,</p>

<p>Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.</p>

<p>Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,</p>

<p>Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,</p>

<p>That through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,</p>

<p>Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,</p>

<p>Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,</p>

<p>And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people.</p>

<p>Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened</p>

<p>To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her</p>

<p>Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.</p>

<p>Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,</p>

<p>Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor</p>

<p>Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.</p>

<p>With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches</p>

<p>Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.</p>

<p>Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,</p>

<p>Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,</p>

<p>As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.</p>

<p>It was no earthly fear. A breath from the region of spirits</p>

<p>Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment</p>

<p>That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.</p>

<p>With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.</p>

<p>1332 henry wadsworth longfellow</p>

<p>Early upon the morrow the march was resumed; and the Shawnee Said, as they journeyed along, 'On the western slope of these mountains Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission. Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus. Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him.' Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered, 'Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!' Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains, Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices, And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river, Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission. Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village, Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A crucifix fastened High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines, Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it. This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the intricate arches Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers, Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches. Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching, Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions. But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen Forth from the handi of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower, Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression, Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest, And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam. There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on cakes of the maize-ear Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher. Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered: 'Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes, Told me this same sad tale; then arose and continued his journey!' Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness; But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed. 'Far to the north he has gone,' continued the priest; 'but in autumn, When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission.' Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive, 'Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted.' So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1333</p>

<p>Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions, Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other, Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving above her, Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels. Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover, But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the cornfield. Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover. 'Patience!' the priest would say; 'have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!</p>

<p>Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,</p>

<p>See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;</p>

<p>This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted</p>

<p>Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller's journey</p>

<p>Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert.</p>

<p>Such in the soul of man is faith. The blossoms of passion,</p>

<p>Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and fuller of fragrance,</p>

<p>But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odor is deadly.</p>

<p>Only this humble plant can guide us here, and hereafter</p>

<p>Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet with the dews of nepenthe.'</p>

<p>So came the autumn, and passed, and the winter,yet Gabriel came not;</p>

<p>Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of the robin and bluebird</p>

<p>Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not.</p>

<p>But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted</p>

<p>Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odor of blossom.</p>

<p>Far to the north and east, it said, in the Michigan forests,</p>

<p>Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River.</p>

<p>And, with returning guides, that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence,</p>

<p>Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the Mission.</p>

<p>When over weary ways, by long and perilous marches,</p>

<p>She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests,</p>

<p>Found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin!</p>

<p>Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in seasons and places Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden;</p>

<p>1334 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions,</p>

<p>Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army,</p>

<p>Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities.</p>

<p>Like a phantom she came, and passed away iinremembered.</p>

<p>Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey;</p>

<p>Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended.</p>

<p>Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,</p>

<p>Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow.</p>

<p>Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,</p>

<p>Dawn of another life, that broke o'er her earthly horizon,</p>

<p>As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware waters,</p>

<p>Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle,</p>

<p>Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.</p>

<p>There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,</p>

<p>And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,</p>

<p>As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.</p>

<p>There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,</p>

<p>Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.</p>

<p>There old Rene Leblanc had died; and when he departed,</p>

<p>Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants.</p>

<p>Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,</p>

<p>Something that spake to her heart, and made her no longer a stranger;</p>

<p>And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers,</p>

<p>For it recalled the past, the old Acadian country,</p>

<p>Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed endeavor,</p>

<p>Ended, to recommence no more upon earth, uncomplaining,</p>

<p>Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned her thoughts and her footsteps.</p>

<p>As from the mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning</p>

<p>Roll away, and afar we behold the landscape below us,</p>

<p>Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,</p>

<p>So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw the world far below her,</p>

<p>Dark no longer, but all illumined with love; and the pathway</p>

<p>Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance.</p>

<p>Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,</p>

<p>Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,</p>

<p>Only more beautiful made by his death-like silence and absence.</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 1335</p>

<p>Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not.</p>

<p>Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;</p>

<p>He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;</p>

<p>Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,</p>

<p>This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.</p>

<p>So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,</p>

<p>Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma.</p>

<p>Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow</p>

<p>Meekly, with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.</p>

<p>Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy, frequenting</p>

<p>Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,</p>

<p>Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,</p>

<p>Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.</p>

<p>Night after night, when the world was asleep, as the watchman repeated</p>

<p>Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,</p>

<p>High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.</p>

<p>Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs</p>

<p>Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market.</p>

<p>Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings.</p>

<p>Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city, Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons, Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn.</p>

<p>And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,</p>

<p>Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,</p>

<p>So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its natural margin,</p>

<p>Spread to a brackish lake, the silver stream of existence.</p>

<p>Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;</p>

<p>But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;</p>

<p>Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,</p>

<p>Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.</p>

<p>Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;</p>

<p>Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket</p>

<p>Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble walls seemed to echo</p>

<p>Softly the words of the Lord: 'The poor ye always have with you.'</p>

<p>Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy. The dying</p>

<p>Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there</p>

<p>Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,</p>

<p>Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,</p>

<p>1336 HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</p>

<p>Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance. Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial, Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.</p>

<p>Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent, Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse. Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden; And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them, That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty. Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridors, cooled by the east-wind, Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,</p>

<p>While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco.</p>

<p>Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit:</p>

<p>Something within her said, 'At length thy trials are ended;'</p>

<p>And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness.</p>

<p>Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,</p>

<p>Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence</p>

<p>Closing the sighdess eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,</p>

<p>Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside.</p>

<p>Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,</p>

<p>Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence</p>

<p>Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.</p>

<p>And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,</p>

<p>Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.</p>

<p>Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;</p>

<p>Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder, Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart, while a shudder Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,</p>

<p>And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning. Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish, That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows. On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man. Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples; But, as he lay in the morning light, his face for a moment</p>

<p>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 337</p>

<p>Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow, Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping. Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard, In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed. Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them, Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and forever, Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,</p>

<p>Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood; So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying. Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever, As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals, That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over. Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness, Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking. Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations, Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like, 'Gabriel 1 O my beloved!' and died away into silence. Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood; Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them, Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow, As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision. Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids, Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside. Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.</p>

<p>Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him. Kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom. Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness, As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.</p>

<p>All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow, All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing, All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience! And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom, Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, 'Father, I thank thee!'</p>

<p>I338 JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER [1807-1802]</p>

<p>792 The Eternal Goodness</p>

<p>O Friends ! with whom my feet have trod The quiet aisles of prayer,</p>

<p>Glad witness to your zeal for God And love of man I bear.</p>

<p>I trace your lines of argument;</p>

<p>Your logic linked and strong I weigh as one who dreads dissent,</p>

<p>And fears a doubt as wrong.</p>

<p>But still my human hands are weak</p>

<p>To hold your iron creeds: Against the words ye bid me speak</p>

<p>My heart within me pleads.</p>

<p>Who fathoms the Eternal Thought?</p>

<p>Who talks of scheme and plan ? The Lord is God! He needeth not</p>

<p>The poor device of man.</p>

<p>I walk with bare, hushed feet the ground Ye tread with boldness shod;</p>

<p>Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labors, Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey.</p>

<p>Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches Dwells another race, with other customs and language. Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom. In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy; Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun, And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story, While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring 'ocean Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1339</p>

<p>I dare not fix with mete and bound The love and power of God.</p>

<p>Ye praise His justice; even such</p>

<p>His pitying love I deem: Ye seek a king; I fain would touch</p>

<p>The robe that hath no seam.</p>

<p>Ye see the curse which overbroods</p>

<p>A world of pain and loss; I hear our Lord's beatitudes</p>

<p>And prayer upon the cross.</p>

<p>More than your schoolmen teach, within</p>

<p>Myself, alas! I know: Too dark ye cannot paint the sin,</p>

<p>Too small the merit show.</p>

<p>I bow my forehead to the dust,</p>

<p>I veil mine eyes for shame, And urge, in trembling self-distrust,</p>

<p>A prayer without a claim.</p>

<p>I see the wrong that round me lies,</p>

<p>I feel the guilt within; I hear, with groan and travail-cries,</p>

<p>The world confess its sin.</p>

<p>Yet, in the maddening maze of things,</p>

<p>And tossed by storm and flood, To one fixed trust my spirit clings;</p>

<p>I know that God is good!</p>

<p>Not mine to look where cherubim</p>

<p>And seraphs may not see, But nothing can be good in Him</p>

<p>Which evil is in me.</p>

<p>The wrong that pains my soul below</p>

<p>I dare not throne above, I know not of His hate,I know</p>

<p>His goodness and His love.</p>

<p>I34O JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>I dimly guess from blessings known Of greater out of sight,</p>

<p>And, with the chastened Psalmist, own His judgments too are right.</p>

<p>I long for household voices gone, For vanished smiles I long,</p>

<p>But God hath led my dear ones on, And He can do no wrong.</p>

<p>I know not what the future hath</p>

<p>Of marvel or surprise, Assured alone that life and death</p>

<p>His mercy underlies.</p>

<p>And if my heart and flesh are weak To bear an untried pain,</p>

<p>The bruised reed He will not break, But strengthen and sustain.</p>

<p>No offering of my own I have, Nor works my faith to prove;</p>

<p>I can but give the gifts He gave, And plead His love for love.</p>

<p>And so beside the Silent Sea I wait the muffled oar;</p>

<p>No harm from Him can come to me On ocean or on shore.</p>

<p>I know not where His islands lift Their fronded palms in air;</p>

<p>I only know I cannot drift Beyond His love and care.</p>

<p>O brothers! if my faith is vain, If hopes like these betray,</p>

<p>Pray for me that my feet may gain The sure and safer way.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>And Thou, O Lord! by whom are seen</p>

<p>Thy creatures as they be, Forgive me if too close I lean</p>

<p>My human heart on Thee!</p>

<p>Randolph of Roanoke</p>

<p>O Mother Earth! upon thy lap</p>

<p>Thy weary ones receiving, And o'er them, silent as a dream,</p>

<p>Thy grassy mantle weaving, Fold softly in thy long embrace</p>

<p>That heart so worn and broken, And cool its pulse of fire beneath</p>

<p>Thy shadows old and oaken.</p>

<p>Shut out from him the bitter word</p>

<p>And serpent hiss of scorning; Nor let the storms of yesterday</p>

<p>Disturb his quiet morning. Breathe over him forgetfulness</p>

<p>Of all save deeds of kindness, And, save to smiles of grateful eyes,</p>

<p>Press down his lids in blindness.</p>

<p>There, where with living ear and eye</p>

<p>He heard Potomac's flowing, And, through his tall ancestral trees,</p>

<p>Saw autumn's sunset glowing, He sleeps, still looking to the west,</p>

<p>Beneath the dark wood shadow, As if he still would see the sun</p>

<p>Sink down on wave and meadow.</p>

<p>Bard, Sage, and Tribune! in himself</p>

<p>All moods of mind contrasting, The tenderest wail of human woe,</p>

<p>The scorn like lightning blasting; The pathos which from rival eyes</p>

<p>Unwilling tears could summon, The stinging taunt, the fiery burst</p>

<p>Of hatred scarcely human!</p>

<p>I342 JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>Mirth, sparkling like a diamond shower,</p>

<p>From lips of life-long sadness; Clear picturings of majestic thought</p>

<p>Upon a ground of madness; And over all Romance and Song</p>

<p>A classic beauty throwing, And laurelled Clio at his side</p>

<p>Her storied pages showing.</p>

<p>All parties feared him: each in turn</p>

<p>Beheld its schemes disjointed, As right or left his fatal glance</p>

<p>And spectral finger pointed. Sworn foe of Cant, he smote it down</p>

<p>With trenchant wit unsparing, And, mocking, rent with ruthless hand</p>

<p>The robe Pretence was wearing.</p>

<p>Too honest or too proud to feign</p>

<p>A love he never cherished, Beyond Virginia's border line</p>

<p>His patriotism perished. While others hailed in distant skies</p>

<p>Our eagle's dusky pinion, He only saw the mountain bird</p>

<p>Stoop o'er his Old Dominion!</p>

<p>Still through each change of fortune strange</p>

<p>Racked nerve, and brain all burning, His loving faith in Mother-land</p>

<p>Knew never shade of turning; By Britain's lakes, by Neva's tide,</p>

<p>Whatever sky was o'er him, He heard her rivers' rushing sound,</p>

<p>Her blue peaks rose before him.</p>

<p>He held his slaves, yet made withal No false and vain pretences,</p>

<p>Nor paid a lying priest to seek For Scriptural defences.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>1343</p>

<p>His harshest words of proud rebuke, His bitterest taunt and scorning,</p>

<p>Fell fire-like on the Northern brow That bent to him in fawning.</p>

<p>He held his slaves; yet kept the while</p>

<p>His reverence for the Human; In the dark vassals of his will</p>

<p>He saw but Man and Woman! No hunter of God's outraged poor</p>

<p>His Roanoke valley entered; No trader in the souls of men</p>

<p>Across his threshold ventured.</p>

<p>And when the old and wearied man</p>

<p>Lay down for his last sleeping, And at his side, a slave no more,</p>

<p>His brother-man stood weeping, His latest thought, his latest breath,</p>

<p>To Freedom's duty giving, With failing tongue and trembling hand</p>

<p>The dying blest the living.</p>

<p>Oh, never bore his ancient State</p>

<p>A truer son or braver! None trampling with a calmer scorn</p>

<p>On foreign hate or favor. He knew her faults, yet never stooped</p>

<p>His proud and manly feeling To poor excuses of the wrong</p>

<p>Or meanness of concealing.</p>

<p>But none beheld with clearer eye</p>

<p>The plague-spot o'er her spreading, None heard more sure the steps of Doom</p>

<p>Along her future treading. For her as for himself he spake,</p>

<p>When, his gaunt frame upbracing, He traced with dying hand 'Remorse!'</p>

<p>And perished in the tracing.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>1344</p>

<p>As from the grave where Henry sleeps,</p>

<p>From Vernon's weeping willow, And from the grassy pall which hides</p>

<p>The Sage of Monticello, So from the leaf-strewn burial-stone</p>

<p>Of Randolph's lowly dwelling, Virginia! o'er thy land of slaves A warning voice is swelling!</p>

<p>And hark! from thy deserted fields</p>

<p>Are sadder warnings spoken, From quenched hearths, where thy exiled sons</p>

<p>Their household gods have broken. The curse is on thee,wolves for men,</p>

<p>And briers for corn-sheaves giving! Oh, more than all thy dead renown Were now one hero living!</p>

<p>794 Massachusetts to Virginia</p>

<p>The blast from Freedom's Northern hills, upon its Southern way,</p>

<p>Bears greeting to Virginia from Massachusetts Bay:</p>

<p>No word of haughty challenging, nor battle bugle's peal,</p>

<p>Nor steady tread of marching files, nor clang of horsemen's steel,</p>

<p>No trains of deep-mouthed cannon along our highways go;</p>

<p>Around our silent arsenals untrodden lies the snow;</p>

<p>And to the land-breeze of our ports, upon their errands far,</p>

<p>A thousand sails of commerce swell, but none are spread for war.</p>

<p>We hear thy threats, Virginia! thy stormy words and high Swell harshly on the Southern winds which melt along our sky; Yet not one brown, hard hand foregoes its honest labor here, No hewer of our mountain oaks suspends his axe in fear.</p>

<p>Wild are the waves which lash the reefs along St. George's bank; Cold on the shores of Labrador the fog lies white and dank; Through storm, and wave, and blinding mist, stout are the hearts which man</p>

<p>The fishing-smacks of Marblehead, the sea-boats of Cape Ann.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1345</p>

<p>The cold north light and wintry sun glare on their icy forms, Bent grimly o'er their straining lines or wrestling with the storms; Free as the winds they drive before, rough as the waves they roam, They laugh to scorn the slaver's threat against their rocky home.</p>

<p>What means the Old Dominion? Hath she forgot the day When o'er her conquered valleys swept the Briton's steel array? How, side by side with sons of hers, the Massachusetts men Encountered Tarleton's charge of fire, and stout Cornwallis, then?</p>

<p>Forgets she how the Bay State, in answer to the call Of her old House of Burgesses, spoke out from Faneuil Hall? When, echoing back her Henry's cry, came pulsing on each breath Of Northern winds the thrilling sounds of 'Liberty or Death!'</p>

<p>What asks the Old Dominion ? If now her sons have proved False to their fathers' memory, false to the faith they loved; If she can scoff at Freedom, and its great charter spurn, Must we of Massachusetts from truth and duty turn ?</p>

<p>We hunt your bondmen, flying from Slavery's hateful hell; Our voices, at your bidding, take up the bloodhound's yell; We gather, at your summons, above our fathers' graves, From Freedom's holy altar-horns to tear your wretched slaves!</p>

<p>Thank God! not yet so vilely can Massachusetts bow; The spirit of her early time is with her even now; Dream not because her Pilgrim blood moves slow and calm and cool,</p>

<p>She thus can stoop her chainless neck, a sister's slave and tool!</p>

<p>All that a sister State should do, all that a free State may, Heart, hand, and purse we proffer, as in our early day; But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone, And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown!</p>

<p>Hold, while ye may, your struggling slaves, and burden God's free air</p>

<p>With woman's shriek beneath the lash, and manhood's wild despair;</p>

<p>I346 JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>Cling closer to the 'cleaving curse' that writes upon your plains The blasting of Almighty wrath against a land of chains.</p>

<p>Still shame your gallant ancestry, the cavaliers of old, By watching round the shambles where human flesh is sold; Gloat o'er the new-born child, and count his market value, when The maddened mother's cry of woe shall pierce the slaver's den!</p>

<p>Lower than plummet soundeth, sink the Virginia name;</p>

<p>Plant, if ye will, your fathers' graves with rankest weeds of shame;</p>

<p>Be, if ye will, the scandal of God's fair universe;</p>

<p>We wash our hands forever of your sin and shame and curse.</p>

<p>A voice from lips whereon the coal from Freedom's shrine hath been,</p>

<p>Thrilled, as but yesterday, the hearts of Berkshire's mountain men: The echoes of that solemn voice are sadly lingering still In all our sunny valleys, on every wind-swept hill.</p>

<p>And when the prowling man-thief came hunting for his prey Beneath the very shadow of Bunker's shaft of gray, How, through the free lips of the son, the father's warning spoke; How, from its bonds of trade and sect, the Pilgrim city broke!</p>

<p>A hundred thousand right arms were lifted up on high, A hundred thousand voices sent back their loud reply; Through the thronged towns of Essex the startling summons rang, And up from bench and loom and wheel her young mechanics sprang!</p>

<p>The voice of free, broad Middlesex, of thousands as of one, The shaft of Bunker calling to that of Lexington; From Norfolk's ancient villages, from Plymouth's rocky bound To where Nantucket feels the arms of ocean close her round;</p>

<p>From rich and rural Worcester, where through the calm repose Of cultured vales and fringing woods the gentle Nashua flows, To where Wachuset's wintry blasts the mountain larches stir, Swelled up to Heaven the thrilling cry of 'God save Latimer!'</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1347</p>

<p>And sandy Barnstable rose up, wet with the salt sea spray; And Bristol sent her answering shout down Narragansett Bay! Along the broad Connecticut old Hampden felt the thrill, And the cheer of Hampshire's woodmen swept down from Holyoke Hill.</p>

<p>The voice of Massachusetts! Of her free sons and daughters, Deep calling unto deep aloud, the sound of many waters! Against the burden of that voice what tyrant power shall stand ? No fetters in the Bay State! No slave upon her land!</p>

<p>Look to it well, Virginians! In calmness we have borne, In answer to our faith and trust, your insult and your scorn; You've spurned our kindest counsels; you've hunted for our lives; And shaken round our hearths and homes your manacles and gyves!</p>

<p>We wage no war, we lift no arm, we fling no torch within The fire-damps of the quaking mine beneath your soil of sin; We leave ye with your bondmen, to wrestle, while ye can, With the strong upward tendencies and God-like soul of man!</p>

<p>But for us and for our children, the vow which we have given For freedom and humanity is registered in heaven; No slave-hunt in our borders,no pirate on our strand! No fetters in the Bay State,no slave upon our land!</p>

<p>795 Barclay of Ury</p>

<p>Up the streets of Aberdeen, By the kirk and college green,</p>

<p>Rode the Laird of Ury; Close behind him, close beside, Foul of mouth and evil-eyed, Pressed the mob in fury.</p>

<p>Flouted him the drunken churl, Jeered at him the serving-girl,</p>

<p>Prompt to please her master; And the begging carlin, late Fed and clothed at Ury's gate,</p>

<p>Cursed him as he passed her.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>Yet, with calm and stately mien, Up the streets of Aberdeen</p>

<p>Came he slowly riding; And, to all he saw and heard, Answering not with bitter word,</p>

<p>Turning not for chiding.</p>

<p>Came a troop with broadswords swinging, Bits and bridles sharply ringing,</p>

<p>Loose and free and froward; Quoth the foremost, 'Ride him down! Push him! prick him! through the town</p>

<p>Drive the Quaker coward!'</p>

<p>But from out the thickening crowd Cried a sudden voice and loud:</p>

<p>'Barclay! Ho! a Barclay!' And the old man at his side Saw a comrade, battle tried,</p>

<p>Scarred and sunburned darkly,</p>

<p>Who with ready weapon bare, Fronting to the troopers there,</p>

<p>Cried aloud: 'God save us, Call ye coward him who stood Ankle deep in Liitzen's blood,</p>

<p>With the brave Gustavus?'</p>

<p>'Nay, I do not need thy sword, Comrade mine,' said Ury's lord.</p>

<p>'Put it up, I pray thee: Passive to His holy will, Trust I in my Master still,</p>

<p>Even though He slay me.</p>

<p>'Pledges of thy love and faith, Proved on many a field of death,</p>

<p>Not by me are needed.' Marvelled much that henchman bold, That his laird, so stout of old,</p>

<p>Now so meekly pleaded.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1349</p>

<p>'Woe's the day!' he sadly said, With a slowly shaking head,</p>

<p>And a look of pity; 'Ury's honest lord reviled, Mock of knave and sport of child,</p>

<p>In his own good city!</p>

<p>'Speak the word, and, master mine, As we charged on Tilly's line,</p>

<p>And his Walloon lancers, Smiting through their midst we'll teach Civil look and decent speech</p>

<p>To these boyish prancers!'</p>

<p>'Marvel not, mine ancient friend, Like beginning, like the end,'</p>

<p>Quoth the Laird of Ury; 'Is the sinful servant more Than his gracious Lord who bore</p>

<p>Bonds and stripes in Jewry?</p>

<p>'Give me joy that in his name I can bear, with patient frame,</p>

<p>All these vain ones offer; While for them He suffereth long, Shall I answer wrong with wrong,</p>

<p>Scoffing with the scoffer?</p>

<p>'Happier I, with loss of all, Hunted, oudawed, held in thrall,</p>

<p>With few friends to greet me, Than when reeve and squire were seen, Riding out from Aberdeen,</p>

<p>With bared heads to meet me.</p>

<p>'When each goodwife, o'er and o'er, Blessed me as I passed her door;</p>

<p>And the snooded daughter, Through her casement glancing down, Smiled on him who bore renown</p>

<p>From red fields of slaughter.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>'Hard to feel the stranger's scoff, Hard the old friend's falling off,</p>

<p>Hard to learn forgiving; But the Lord His own rewards, And His love with theirs accords,</p>

<p>Warm and fresh and living.</p>

<p>'Through this dark and stormy night Faith beholds a feeble light</p>

<p>Up the blackness streaking; Knowing God's own time is best, In a patient hope I rest</p>

<p>For the full day-breaking!'</p>

<p>So the Laird of Ury said, Turning slow his horse's head</p>

<p>Towards the Tolbooth prison, Where, through iron gates, he heard Poor disciples of the Word</p>

<p>Preach of Christ arisen!</p>

<p>Not in vain, Confessor old, Unto us the tale is told</p>

<p>Of thy day of trial; Every age on him who strays From its broad and beaten ways</p>

<p>Pours its seven-fold vial.</p>

<p>Happy he whose inward ear Angel comfortings can hear,</p>

<p>O'er the rabble's laughter; And while Hatred's fagots burn, Glimpses through the smoke discern</p>

<p>Of the good hereafter.</p>

<p>Knowing this, that never yet Share of Truth was vainly set</p>

<p>In the world's wide fallow; After hands shall sow the seed, After hands from hill and mead</p>

<p>Reap the harvests yellow.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER I35I</p>

<p>Thus, with somewhat of the Seer, Must the moral pioneer</p>

<p>From the Future borrow; Clothe the waste with dreams of grain, And, on midnight's sky of rain,</p>

<p>Paint the golden morrow!</p>

<p>796 Maud Muller</p>

<p>Maud Muller on a summer's day Raked the meadow sweet with hay.</p>

<p>Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth Of simple beauty and rustic health.</p>

<p>Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee The mock-bird echoed from his tree.</p>

<p>But when she glanced to the far-off town, White from its hill-slope looking down,</p>

<p>The sweet song died, and a vague unrest And a nameless longing filled her breast,</p>

<p>A wish that she hardly dared to own, For something better than she had known.</p>

<p>The Judge rode slowly down the lane, Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane.</p>

<p>He drew his bridle in the shade Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,</p>

<p>And asked a draught from the spring that flowed Through the meadow across the road.</p>

<p>She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up, And filled for him her small tin cup,</p>

<p>And blushed as she gave it, looking down On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown.</p>

<p>1352 JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>'Thanks!' said the Judge; 'a sweeter draught From a fairer hand was never quaffed.'</p>

<p>He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees, Of the singing birds and the humming bees;</p>

<p>Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.</p>

<p>And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown, And her graceful ankles bare and brown;</p>

<p>And listened, while a pleased surprise Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.</p>

<p>At last, like one who for delay Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away.</p>

<p>Maud Muller looked and sighed: 'Ah me! That I the Judge's bride might be!</p>

<p>'He would dress me up in silks so fine, And praise and toast me at his wine.</p>

<p>'My father should wear a broadcloth coat; My brother should sail a painted boat.</p>

<p>'I'd dress my mother so grand and gay,</p>

<p>And the baby should have a new toy each day.</p>

<p>'And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor, And all should bless me who left our door.'</p>

<p>The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill And saw Maud Muller standing still.</p>

<p>'A form more fair, a face more sweet, Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet.</p>

<p>'And her modest answer and graceful air Show her wise and good as she is fair.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1353</p>

<p>'Would she were mine, and I to-day, Like her, a harvester of hay;</p>

<p>'No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs, Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,</p>

<p>'But low of cattle and song of birds, And health and quiet and loving words.'</p>

<p>But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold, And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.</p>

<p>So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on, And Maud was left in the field alone.</p>

<p>But the lawyers smiled that afternoon, When he hummed in court an old love-tune;</p>

<p>And the young girl mused beside the well Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.</p>

<p>He wedded a wife of richest dower, Who lived for fashion, as he for power.</p>

<p>Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow, He watched a picture come and go;</p>

<p>And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes Looked out in their innocent surprise.</p>

<p>Oft, when the wine in his glass was red, He longed for the wayside well instead;</p>

<p>And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.</p>

<p>And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain, 'Ah, that I were free again!</p>

<p>J354 JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>'Free as when I rode that day,</p>

<p>Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay.'</p>

<p>She wedded a man unlearned and poor, And many children played round her door.</p>

<p>But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain, Left their traces on heart and brain.</p>

<p>And oft, when the summer sun shone hot On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,</p>

<p>And she heard the little spring brook fall Over the roadside, through the wall,</p>

<p>In the shade of the apple-tree again She saw a rider draw his rein;</p>

<p>And, gazing down with timid grace, She felt his pleased eyes read her face.</p>

<p>Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls Stretched away into stately halls;</p>

<p>The weary wheel to a spinnet turned, The tallow candle an astral burned,</p>

<p>And for him who sat by the chimney lug, Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug,</p>

<p>A manly form at her side she saw, And joy was duty and love was law.</p>

<p>Then she took up her burden of life again, Saying only, 'It might have been.'</p>

<p>Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,</p>

<p>For rich repiner and household drudge!</p>

<p>God pity them both! and pity us all, Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been</p>

<p>Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies Deeply buried from human eyes;</p>

<p>And, in the hereafter, angels may Roll the stone from its grave away!</p>

<p>The Barefoot Boy Blessings on thee, little man, Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan! With thy turned-up pantaloons, And thy merry whistled tunes; With thy red lip, redder still Kissed by strawberries on the hill; With the sunshine on thy face, Through thy torn brim's jaunty grace; From my heart I give thee joy, I was once a barefoot boy! Prince thou art,the grown-up man Only is republican. Let the million-dollared ride! Barefoot, trudging at his side, Thou hast more than he can buy In the reach of ear and eye, Outward sunshine, inward joy: Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!</p>

<p>Oh for boyhood's painless play, Sleep that wakes in laughing day, Health that mocks the doctor's rules, Knowledge never learned of schools, Of the wild bee's morning chase, Of the wild-flower's time and place, Flight of fowl and habitude Of the tenants of the wood; How the tortoise bears his shell, How the woodchuck digs his cell, And the ground-mole sinks his well;</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>How the robin feeds her young, How the oriole's nest is hung; Where the whitest lilies blow, Where the freshest berries grow, Where the ground-nut trails its vine, Where the wood-grape's clusters shine; Of the black wasp's cunning way, Mason of his walls of clay, And the architectural plans Of gray hornet artisans! For, eschewing books and tasks, Nature answers all he asks; Hand in hand with her he walks, Face to face with her he talks, Part and parcel of her joy, Blessings on the barefoot boy!</p>

<p>Oh for boyhood's time of June, Crowding years in one brief moon, When all things I heard or saw, Me, their master, waited for. I was rich in flowers and trees, Humming-birds and honey-bees; For my sport the squirrel played, Plied the snouted mole his spade; For my taste the blackberry cone Purpled over hedge and stone; Laughed the brook for my delight Through the day and through the night, Whispering at the garden wall, Talked with me from fall to fall; Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond, Mine the walnut slopes beyond, Mine, on bending orchard trees, Apples of Hesperides! Still as my horizon grew, Larger grew my riches too; All the world I saw or knew Seemed a complex Chinese toy, Fashioned for a barefoot boy!</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1357</p>

<p>Oh for festal dainties spread, Like my bowl of milk and bread; Pewter spoon and bowl of wood, On the door-stone, gray and rude! O'er me, like a regal tent, Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent, Purple-curtained, fringed with gold, Looped in many a wind-swung fold; While for music came the play Of the pied frogs' orchestra; And, to light the noisy choir, Lit the fly his lamp of fire. I was monarch: pomp and joy Waited on the barefoot boy!</p>

<p>Cheerily, then, my little man, Live and laugh, as boyhood can! Though the flinty slopes be hard, Stubble-speared the new-mown sward, Every morn shall lead thee through Fresh baptisms of the dew; Every evening from thy feet Shall the cool wind kiss the heat: All too soon these feet must hide In the prison cells of pride, Lose the freedom of the sod, Like a colt's for work be shod, Made to tread the mills of toil, Up and down in ceaseless moil: Happy if their track be found Never on forbidden ground; Happy if they sink not in Quick and treacherous sands of sin. Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy, Ere it passes, barefoot boy!</p>

<p>798 Skipper Ireson's Ride</p>

<p>Of all the rides since the birth of time, Told in story or sung in rhyme, On Apuleius's Golden Ass,</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>Or one-eyed Calender's horse of brass,</p>

<p>Witch astride of a human back,</p>

<p>Islam's prophet on Al-Borak,</p>

<p>The strangest ride that ever was sped</p>

<p>Was Ireson's, out from Marblehead! Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</p>

<p>Body of turkey, head of owl, Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl, Feathered and ruffled in every part, Skipper Ireson stood in the cart. Scores of women, old and young, Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue, Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane, Shouting and singing the shrill refrain: ' Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!'</p>

<p>Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips,</p>

<p>Girls in bloom of cheek and lips,</p>

<p>Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase</p>

<p>Bacchus round some antique vase,</p>

<p>Brief of skirt, with ankles bare,</p>

<p>Loose of kerchief and loose of hair,</p>

<p>With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns' twang,</p>

<p>Over and over the Maenads sang:</p>

<p>' Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!'</p>

<p>Small pity for him!He sailed away From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay, Sailed away from a sinking wreck, With his own town's-people on her deck! ' Lay by! lay by!' they called to him. Back he answered, 'Sink or swim! Brag of your catch of fish again!'</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER 1359</p>

<p>And off he sailed through the fog and rain! Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</p>

<p>Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur</p>

<p>That wreck shall lie forevermore.</p>

<p>Mother and sister, wife and maid,</p>

<p>Looked from the rocks of Marblehead</p>

<p>Over the moaning and rainy sea,</p>

<p>Looked for the coming that might not be!</p>

<p>What did the winds and the sea-birds say</p>

<p>Of the cruel captain who sailed away? Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</p>

<p>Through the street, on either side,</p>

<p>Up flew windows, doors swung wide;</p>

<p>Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray,</p>

<p>Treble lent the fish-horn's bray.</p>

<p>Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound,</p>

<p>Hulks of old sailors run aground,</p>

<p>Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane,</p>

<p>And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain: ' Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' f utherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!'</p>

<p>Sweetly along the Salem road</p>

<p>Bloom of orchard and lilac showed.</p>

<p>Little the wicked skipper knew</p>

<p>Of the fields so green and the sky so blue.</p>

<p>Riding there in his sorry trim,</p>

<p>Like an Indian idol glum and grim,</p>

<p>Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear</p>

<p>Of voices shouting, far and near:</p>

<p>' Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt, Torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt By the women o' Morble'ead!'</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>'Hear me, neighbors!' at last he cried, 'What to me is this noisy ride? What is the shame that clothes the skin To the nameless horror that lives within? Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck, And hear a cry from a reeling deck! Hate me and curse me,I only dread The hand of God and the face of the dead!' Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</p>

<p>Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea Said, 'God has touched him! why should we Said an old wife mourning her only son, 'Cut the rogue's tether and let him run!' So with soft relentings and rude excuse, Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose, And gave him a cloak to hide him in, And left him alone with his shame and sin. Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart, Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead!</p>

<p>The Pipes at Lucknow</p>

<p>Pipes of the misty moorlands,</p>

<p>Voice of the glens and hills; The droning of the torrents,</p>

<p>The treble of the rills! Not the braes of bloom and heather,</p>

<p>Nor the mountains dark with rain, Nor maiden bower, nor border tower,</p>

<p>Have heard your sweetest strain!</p>

<p>Dear to the Lowland reaper,</p>

<p>And plaided mountaineer, To the cottage and the castle</p>

<p>The Scottish pipes are dear; Sweet sounds the ancient pibroch</p>

<p>O'er mountain, loch, and glade;</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>But the sweetest of all music The pipes at Lucknow played.</p>

<p>Day by day the Indian tiger</p>

<p>Louder yelled, and nearer crept; Round and round the jungle-serpent</p>

<p>Near and nearer circles swept. 'Pray for rescue, wives and mothers,</p>

<p>Pray to-day!' the soldier said; 'To-morrow, death's between us</p>

<p>And the wrong and shame we dread.'</p>

<p>Oh, they listened, looked, and waited,</p>

<p>Till their hope became despair; And the sobs of low bewailing</p>

<p>Filled the pauses of their prayer. Then up spake a Scottish maiden,</p>

<p>With her ear unto the ground: 'Dinna ye hear it?dinna ye hear it?</p>

<p>The pipes o' Havelock sound!'</p>

<p>Hushed the wounded man his groaning;</p>

<p>Hushed the wife her little ones; Alone they heard the drum-roll</p>

<p>And the roar of Sepoy guns. But to sounds of home and childhood</p>

<p>The Highland ear was true; As her mother's cradle-crooning</p>

<p>The mountain pipes she knew.</p>

<p>Like the march of soundless music</p>

<p>Through the vision of the seer, More of feeling than of hearing,</p>

<p>Of the heart than of the ear, She knew the droning pibroch,</p>

<p>She knew the Campbell's call: 'Hark! hear ye no MacGregor's,</p>

<p>The grandest o' them all!'</p>

<p>Oh, they listened, dumb and breathless, And they caught the sound at last;</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>Faint and far beyond the Goomtee Rose and fell the piper's blast!</p>

<p>Then a burst of wild thanksgiving Mingled woman's voice and man's;</p>

<p>'God be praised!the march of Havelock! The piping of the clans!'</p>

<p>Louder, nearer, fierce as vengeance,</p>

<p>Sharp and shrill as swords at strife, Came the wild MacGregor's clan-call,</p>

<p>Stinging all the air to life. But when the far-off dust-cloud</p>

<p>To plaided legions grew, Full tenderly and blithesomely</p>

<p>The pipes of rescue blew!</p>

<p>Round the silver domes of Lucknow,</p>

<p>Moslem mosque and Pagan shrine, Breathed the air to Britons dearest,</p>

<p>The air of Auld Lang Syne. O'er the cruel roll of war-drums</p>

<p>Rose that sweet and homelike strain; And the tartan clove the turban,</p>

<p>As the Goomtee cleaves the plain.</p>

<p>Dear to the corn-land reaper</p>

<p>And plaided mountaineer, To the cottage and the castle</p>

<p>The piper's song is dear. Sweet sounds the Gaelic pibroch</p>

<p>O'er mountain, glen, and glade; But the sweetest of all music</p>

<p>The pipes at Lucknow played!</p>

<p>Barbara Frietchie Up from the meadows rich with corn, Clear in the cool September morn,</p>

<p>The clustered spires of Frederick stand Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>Round about them orchards sweep, Apple and peach tree fruited deep,</p>

<p>Fair as the garden of the Lord</p>

<p>To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,</p>

<p>On that pleasant morn of the early fall When Lee marched over the mountain-wall;</p>

<p>Over the mountains winding down, Horse and foot, into Frederick town.</p>

<p>Forty flags with their silver stars, Forty flags with their crimson bars,</p>

<p>Flapped in the morning wind: the sun Of noon looked down, and saw not one.</p>

<p>Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then, Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;</p>

<p>Bravest of all in Frederick town,</p>

<p>She took up the flag the men hauled down;</p>

<p>In her attic window the staff she set, To show that one heart was loyal yet.</p>

<p>Up the street came the rebel tread, Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.</p>

<p>Under his slouched hat left and right He glanced; the old flag met his sight</p>

<p>'Halt!'the dust-brown ranks stood fast. 'Fire!'out blazed the rifle-blast.</p>

<p>It shivered the window, pane and sash; It rent the banner with seam and gash.</p>

<p>Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf.</p>

<p>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</p>

<p>She leaned far out on the window-sill, And shook it forth with a royal will.</p>

<p>'Shoot, if you must, this old gray head, But spare your country's flag,' she said.</p>

<p>A shade of sadness, a blush of shame, Over the face of the leader came;</p>

<p>The nobler nature within him stirred To life at that woman's deed and word;</p>

<p>'Who touches a hair of yon gray head Dies like a dog! March on!' he said.</p>

<p>All day long through Frederick street Sounded the tread of marching feet:</p>

<p>All day long that free flag tost Over the heads of the rebel host.</p>

<p>Ever its torn folds rose and fell</p>

<p>On the loyal winds that loved it well;</p>

<p>And through the hill-gaps sunset light Shone over it with a warm good-night.</p>

<p>Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,</p>

<p>And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.</p>

<p>Honor to her! and let a tear</p>

<p>Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.</p>

<p>Over Barbara Frietchie's grave, Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!</p>

<p>Peace and order and beauty draw Round thy symbol of light and law;</p>

<p>And ever the stars above look down On thy stars below in Frederick town!</p>

<p>i</p>

<p>OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES [1800-1804]</p>

<p>The Chambered Nautilus This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign, Sails the unshadowed main, The venturous bark that flings On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings In gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings, And coral reefs lie bare, Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.</p>

<p>Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;</p>

<p>Wrecked is the ship of pearl 1</p>

<p>And every chambered cell, Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell, As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,</p>

<p>Before thee lies revealed, Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!</p>

<p>Year after year beheld the silent toil</p>

<p>That spread his lustrous coil;</p>

<p>Still, as the spiral grew, He left the past year's dwelling for the new, Stole with soft step its shining archway through,</p>

<p>Built up its idle door, Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,</p>

<p>Child of the wandering sea,</p>

<p>Cast from her lap, forlorn! From thy dead lips a clearer note is born Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!</p>

<p>While on mine ear it rings, Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:-</p>

<p>Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, As the swift seasons roll! Leave thy low-vaulted past!</p>

<p>802 . Old Ironsides1</p>

<p>Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!</p>

<p>Long has it waved on high, And many an eye has danced to see</p>

<p>That banner in the sky; Beneath it rung the battle shout,</p>

<p>And burst the cannon's roar; The meteor of the ocean air</p>

<p>Shall sweep the clouds no more.</p>

<p>Her deck once red with heroes' blood,</p>

<p>Where knelt the vanquished foe, When winds were hurrying o'er the flood</p>

<p>And waves were white below, No more shall feel the victor's tread,</p>

<p>Or know the conquered knee; The harpies of the shore shall pluck</p>

<p>The eagle of the sea!</p>

<p>Oh, better that her shattered hulk</p>

<p>Should sink beneath the wave; Her thunders shook the mighty deep,</p>

<p>And there should be her grave: Nail to the mast her holy flag,</p>

<p>Set every threadbare sail, And give her to the god of storms,</p>

<p>The lightning and the gale!</p>

<p>They say that in his prime, Ere the pruning-knife of Time</p>

<p>Cut him down, Not a better man was found By the Crier on his round</p>

<p>Through the town.</p>

<p>But now he walks the streets, And he looks at all he meets</p>

<p>Sad and wan; And shakes his feeble head, That it seems as if he said,</p>

<p>"They are gone."</p>

<p>The mossy marbles rest On the lips that he has prest</p>

<p>In their bloom; And the names he loved to hear Have been carved for many a year</p>

<p>On the tomb.</p>

<p>My grandmamma has said Poor old lady, she is dead</p>

<p>Long ago That he had a Roman nose, And his cheek was like a rose</p>

<p>In the snow.</p>

<p>But now his nose is thin, And it rests upon his chin</p>

<p>I only wish a hut of stone (A very plain brown stone will do)</p>

<p>That I may call my o*n; And close at hand is such a one, In yonder street that fronts the sun.</p>

<p>Plain food is quite enough for me;</p>

<p>Three courses are as good as ten; If Nature can subsist on three,</p>

<p>And glad Truth's yet mightier man-child leaps beneath the Future's</p>

<p>So the Evil's triumph sendeth, with a terror and a chill, Under continent to continent, the sense of coming ill, And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels his sympathies with God In hot tear-drops ebbing earthward, to be drunk up by the sod, Till a corpse crawls round unburied, delving in the nobler clod.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL [1819-1891]</p>

<p>805</p>

<p>The Present Crisis</p>

<p>heart.</p>

<p>For mankind are one in spirit, and an instinct bears along, Round the earth's electric circle, the swift flash of right or wrong;</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL I37I</p>

<p>Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity's vast frame Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush of joy or shame; In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal claim.</p>

<p>Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide, In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side; Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight, Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right, And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.</p>

<p>Hast thou chosen, O my people, on whose party thou shalt stand, Ere the Doom from its worn sandals shakes the dust against our land? Though the cause of Evil prosper, yet 'tis Truth alone is strong, And, albeit she wander outcast now, I see around her throng Troops of beautiful, tall angels, to enshield her from all wrong.</p>

<p>Backward look across the ages and the beacon-moments see, That, like peaks of some sunk continent, jut through Oblivion's sea; Not an ear in court or market for the low foreboding cry Of those Crises, God's stern winnowers, from whose feet earth's chaff must fly;</p>

<p>Never shows the choice momentous till the judgment hath passed by.</p>

<p>Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record</p>

<p>One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;</p>

<p>Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,</p>

<p>Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,</p>

<p>Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.</p>

<p>We see dimly in the Present what is small and what is great,</p>

<p>Slow of faith how weak an arm may turn the iron helm of fate,</p>

<p>But the soul is still oracular; amid the market's din,</p>

<p>List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within,</p>

<p>'They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin.'</p>

<p>Slavery, the earth-born Cyclops, fellest of the giant brood, Sons of brutish Force and Darkness, who have drenched the earth with blood,</p>

<p>Famished in his self-made desert, blinded by our purer day,</p>

<p>Gropes in yet unblasted regions for his miserable prey;</p>

<p>Shall we guide his gory fingers where our helpless children play ?</p>

<p>1372 JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched crust, Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 'tis prosperous to be just; Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside, Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified, And the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.</p>

<p>Count me o'er earth's chosen heroes,they were souls that stood alone,</p>

<p>While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone,</p>

<p>Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline</p>

<p>To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,</p>

<p>By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design.</p>

<p>By the light of burning heretics Christ's bleeding feet I track, Toiling up new Calvaries ever with the cross that turns not back, And these mounts of anguish number how each generation learned One new word of that grand Credo which in prophet-hearts hath burned Since the first man stood God-conquered with his face to heaven upturned.</p>

<p>For Humanity sweeps onward: where to-day the martyr stands, On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands; Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling fagots burn, While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return To glean up the scattered ashes into History's golden urn.</p>

<p>'Tis as easy to be heroes as to sit the idle slaves Of a legendary virtue carved upon our father's graves, Worshippers of light ancestral make the present light a crime; Was the Mayflower launched by cowards, steered by men behind their time?</p>

<p>Turn those tracks toward Past or Future, that make Plymouth Rock sublime?</p>

<p>They were men of present valor, stalwart old iconoclasts,</p>

<p>Unconvinced by axe or gibbet that all virtue was the Past's;</p>

<p>But we make their truth our falsehood, thinking that hath made us free,</p>

<p>Hoarding it in mouldy parchments, while our tender spirits flee</p>

<p>The rude grasp of that great Impulse which drove them across the sea.</p>

<p>They have rights who dare maintain them; we are traitors to our sires,</p>

<p>Smothering in their holy ashes Freedom's new-lit altar-fires;</p>

<p>Shall we make their creed our jailer? Shall we, in our haste to slay,</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL 1373</p>

<p>From the tombs of the old prophets steal the funeral lamps away To light up the martyr-fagots round the prophets of to-day ?</p>

<p>New occasions teach new duties; Time makes ancient good uncouth; They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of Truth; Lo, before us gleam her camp-fires! we ourselves must Pilgrims be, Launch our Mayflower, and steer boldly through the desperate winter sea, Nor attempt the Future's portal with the Past's blood-rusted key.</p>

<p>806 The Pious Editor's Creed</p>

<p>I du believe in Freedom's cause,</p>

<p>Ez fur away ez Payris is; I love to see her stick her claws</p>

<p>In them infarnal Phayrisees; It's wal enough agin a king</p>

<p>To dror resolves an' triggers, But libbaty's a kind o' thing</p>

<p>Thet don't agree with niggers.</p>

<p>I du believe the people want</p>

<p>A tax on teas an' coffees, Thet nothin' aint extravygunt,</p>

<p>Purvidin' I'm in office; Fer I hev loved my country sence</p>

<p>My eye-teeth filled their sockets, An' Uncle Sam I reverence,</p>

<p>Partic'larly his pockets.</p>

<p>I du believe in any plan</p>

<p>O' levyin' the taxes, Ez long ez, like a lumberman,</p>

<p>I git jest wut I axes; I go free-trade thru thick an' thin,</p>

<p>Because it kind o' rouses The folks to vote,an' keeps us in</p>

<p>Our quiet custom-houses.</p>

<p>I du believe it's wise an' good</p>

<p>To sen' out furrin missions, Thet is, on sartin understood</p>

<p>An' orthydox conditions;</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>I mean nine thousan' dolls, per ann., Nine thousan' more fer outfit,</p>

<p>An' me to recommend a man The place 'ould jest about fit.</p>

<p>I du believe in special ways</p>

<p>O' prayin' an' convartin'; The bread comes back in many days,</p>

<p>An' buttered, tu, fer sartin; I mean in preyin' till one busts</p>

<p>On wut the party chooses, An' in convartin' public trusts</p>

<p>To very privit uses.</p>

<p>I du believe hard coin the stuff</p>

<p>Fer 'lectioneers to spout on; The people's oilers soft enough</p>

<p>To make hard money out on; Dear Uncle Sam pervides fer his,</p>

<p>An' gives a good-sized junk to all, I don't care how hard money is,</p>

<p>Ez long ez mine's paid punctooal.</p>

<p>I du believe with all my soul</p>

<p>In the gret Press's freedom, To pint the people to the goal</p>

<p>An' in the traces lead 'em; Palsied the arm thet forges yokes</p>

<p>At my fat contracts squintin', An' withered be the nose thet pokes</p>

<p>Inter the gov'ment printin'!</p>

<p>I du believe thet I should give</p>

<p>Wut's his'n unto Caesar, Fer it's by him I move an' live,</p>

<p>Frum him my bread an' cheese air; I du believe thet all o' me</p>

<p>Doth bear his superscription, Will, conscience, honor, honesty,</p>

<p>An' things o' thet description.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>1375</p>

<p>I du believe in prayer an' praise</p>

<p>To him thet hez the grantin' O' jobs,in every thin' thet pays,</p>

<p>But most of all in Cantin'; This doth my cup with marcies fill,</p>

<p>This lays all thought o' sin to rest, I don't believe in princerple,</p>

<p>But oh, I du in interest.</p>

<p>I du believe in bein' this</p>

<p>Or thet, ez it may happen One way or't other hendiest is</p>

<p>To ketch the people nappin'; It aint by princerples nor men</p>

<p>My preudunt course is steadied, I scent wich pays the best, an' then</p>

<p>Go into it baldheaded.</p>

<p>I du believe thet holdin' slaves</p>

<p>Comes nat'ral to a Presidunt, Let 'lone the rowdedow it saves</p>

<p>To hev a wal-broke precedunt; Fer any office, small or gret,</p>

<p>I couldn't ax with no face, 'uthout I'd ben, thru dry an' wet,</p>

<p>Th' unrizzest kind o' doughface.</p>

<p>I du believe wutever trash</p>

<p>'11 keep the people in blindness, Thet we the Mexicuns can thrash</p>

<p>Right inter brotherly kindness, Thet bombshells, grape, an' powder 'n' ball</p>

<p>Air good-will's strongest magnets, Thet peace, to make it stick at all,</p>

<p>Must be druv in with bagnets.</p>

<p>In short, I firmly du believe</p>

<p>In Humbug generally, Fer it's a thing thet I perceive</p>

<p>To hev a solid vally;</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>This heth my faithful shepherd ben, In pasturs sweet heth led me,</p>

<p>An' this '11 keep the people green To feed ez they hev fed me.</p>

<p>The Courtin' God makes sech nights, all white an' still</p>

<p>Fur 'z you can look or listen, Moonshine an' snow on field an' hill,</p>

<p>All silence an' all glisten.</p>

<p>Zekle crep' up quite unbeknown An' peeked in thru' the winder,</p>

<p>An' there sot Huldy all alone, 'ith no one nigh to hender.</p>

<p>A fireplace filled the room's one side With half a cord o' wood in</p>

<p>There war n't no stoves (tell comfort died) To bake ye to a puddin'.</p>

<p>The wa'nut logs shot sparkles out Towards the pootiest, bless her,</p>

<p>An' leetle flames danced all about The chiny on the dresser.</p>

<p>Agin the chimbley crook-necks hung,</p>

<p>An' in amongst 'em rusted The ole queen's-arm thet gran'ther Young</p>

<p>Fetched back f'om Concord busted.</p>

<p>The very room, coz she was in, Seemed warm f'om floor to ceilin',</p>

<p>An' she looked full ez rosy agin Ez the apples she was peelin'.</p>

<p>'Twas kin' o' kingdom-come to look</p>

<p>On sech a blessed cretur, A dogrose blushin' to a brook</p>

<p>Ain't modester nor sweeter.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL 1377</p>

<p>He was six foot o' man, A i,</p>

<p>Clear grit an' human natur', None couldn't quicker pitch a ton</p>

<p>Nor dror a furrer straighter.</p>

<p>He'd sparked it with full twenty gals, Hed squired 'em, danced 'em, druv 'em,</p>

<p>Fust this one, an' then thet, by spells All is, he couldn't love 'em.</p>

<p>But long o' her his veins 'ould run</p>

<p>All crinkly like curled maple, The side she breshed felt full o' sun</p>

<p>Ez a south slope in Ap'il.</p>

<p>She thought no v'ice hed sech a swing</p>

<p>Ez hisn in the choir; My! when he made Ole Hunderd ring,</p>

<p>She l{nowed the Lord was nigher.</p>

<p>An' she'd blush scarlit, right in prayer,</p>

<p>When her new meetin'-bunnet Felt somehow thru' its crown a pair</p>

<p>O' blue eyes sot upun it.</p>

<p>Thet night, I tell ye, she looked some!</p>

<p>She seemed to've gut a new soul, For she felt sartin-sure he'd come,</p>

<p>Down to her very shoe-sole.</p>

<p>She heered a foot, an' knowed it tu,</p>

<p>A-raspin' on the scraper, All ways to once her feelins flew</p>

<p>Like sparks in burnt-up paper.</p>

<p>He kin' o' l'itered on the mat,</p>

<p>Some doubtfle o' the sekle, His heart kep' goin' pity-pat,</p>

<p>But hern went pity Zekle.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>An' yit she gin her cheer a jerk Ez though she wished him furder,</p>

<p>An' on her apples kep' to work, Parin' away like murder.</p>

<p>' You want to see my Pa, I s'pose?'</p>

<p>' Wal ... no ... I come dasignin'' 'To see my Ma? She's sprinklin' clo'es</p>

<p>Agin to-morror's i'nin'.'</p>

<p>To say why gals acts so or so,</p>

<p>Or don't, 'ould be persumin'; Mebby to mean yes an' say no</p>

<p>Comes nateral to women.</p>

<p>He stood a spell on one foot fust, Then stood a spell on t'other,</p>

<p>An' on which one he felt the wust He couldn't ha' told ye nuther.</p>

<p>Says he, ' I'd better call agin;'</p>

<p>Says she,' Think likely, Mister:' Thet last word pricked him like a pin,</p>

<p>An' . . . Wal, he up an' kist her.</p>

<p>When Ma bimeby upon 'em slips,</p>

<p>Huldy sot pale ez ashes, All kin' o' smily roun' the lips</p>

<p>An' teary roun' the lashes.</p>

<p>For she was jes' the quiet kind</p>

<p>Whose naturs never vary, Like streams that keep a summer mind</p>

<p>Snowhid in Jenooary.</p>

<p>The blood clost roun' her heart felt glued</p>

<p>Too tight for all expressin', Tell mother see how metters stood,</p>

<p>An' gin 'em both her blessin'.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>1379</p>

<p>Then her red come back like the tide</p>

<p>Down to the Bay o' Fundy, An' all I know is they was cried</p>

<p>In meetin' come nex' Sunday.</p>

<p>Ode Recited at the Harvard Commemoration</p>

<p>July 21, 1865 i</p>

<p>Weak-winged is song, Nor aims at that clear-ethered height Whither the brave deed climbs for light:</p>

<p>We seem to do them wrong, Bringing our robin's-leaf to deck their hearse Who in warm life-blood wrote their nobler verse, Our trivial song to honor those who come With ears attuned to strenuous trump and drum, And shaped in squadron-strophes their desire, Live battle-odes whose lines were steel and fire:</p>

<p>Yet sometimes feathered words are strong, A gracious memory to buoy up and save From Lethe's dreamless ooze, the common grave</p>

<p>Of the unventurous throng.</p>

<p>11</p>

<p>To-day our Reverend Mother welcomes back Her wisest Scholars, those who understood The deeper teaching of her mystic tome,</p>

<p>And offered their fresh lives to make it good:</p>

<p>No lore of Greece or Rome, No science peddling with the names of things, Or reading stars to find inglorious fates,</p>

<p>Can lift our life with wings Far from Death's idle gulf that for the many waits,</p>

<p>And lengthen out our dates With that clear fame whose memory sings In manly hearts to come, and nerves them and dilates: Nor such thy teaching, Mother of us all!</p>

<p>Not such the trumpet-call</p>

<p>Of thy diviner mood,</p>

<p>That could thy sons entice</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>1380</p>

<p>From happy homes and toils, the fruitful nest Of those half-virtues which the world calls best, Into War's tumult rude; But rather far that stern device The sponsors chose that round thy cradle stood In the dim, unventured wood, The Veritas1 that lurks beneath The letter's unprolific sheath, Life of whate'er makes life worth living, Seed-grain of high emprise, immortal food, One heavenly thing whereof earth hath the giving.</p>

<p>hi</p>

<p>Many loved Truth, and lavished life's best oil</p>

<p>Amid the dust of books to find her,</p>

<p>Content at last, for guerdon of their toil,</p>

<p>With the cast mantle she hath left behind her.</p>

<p>Many in sad faith sought for her,</p>

<p>Many with crossed hands sighed for her;</p>

<p>But these, our brothers, fought for her,</p>

<p>At life's dear peril wrought for her,</p>

<p>So loved her that they died for her,</p>

<p>Tasting the raptured fleetness</p>

<p>Of her divine completeness:</p>

<p>Their higher instinct knew</p>

<p>Those love her best who to themselves are true,</p>

<p>And what they dare to dream of, dare to do;</p>

<p>They followed her and found her</p>

<p>Where all may hope to find,</p>

<p>Not in the ashes of the burnt-out mind,</p>

<p>But beautiful, with danger's sweetness round her.</p>

<p>Where faith made whole with deed</p>

<p>Breathes its awakening breath</p>

<p>Into the lifeless creed,</p>

<p>They saw her plumed and mailed,</p>

<p>With sweet, stern face unveiled,</p>

<p>And all-repaying eyes, look proud on them in death.</p>

<p>1 Veritas, the motto on the seal of Harvard University, inscribed upon three open books.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>rv</p>

<p>Our slender life runs rippling by, and glides Into the silent hollow of the past;</p>

<p>What is there that abides To make the next age better for the last?</p>

<p>Is earth too poor to give us Something to live for here that shall outlive us? Some more substantial boon Than such as flows and ebbs with Fortune's fickle moon? The little that we see From doubt is never free; The little that we do Is but half-nobly true; With our laborious hiving What men call treasure, and the gods call dross, Life seems a jest of Fate's contriving, Only secure in every one's conniving, A long account of nothings paid with loss, Where we poor puppets, jerked by unseen wires,</p>

<p>After our little hour of strut and rave, With all our pasteboard passions and desires, Loves, hates, ambitions, and immortal fires, Are tossed pell-mell together in the grave. But stay! no age was e'er degenerate, Unless men held it at too cheap a rate, For in our likeness still we shape our fate.</p>

<p>Ah, there is something here Unfathomed by the cynic's sneer, Something that gives our feeble light A high immunity from Night, Something that leaps life's narrow bars To claim its birthright with the hosts of heaven; A seed of sunshine that can leaven Our earthly dullness with the beams of stars,</p>

<p>And glorify our clay With light from fountains elder than the Day; A conscience more divine than we, A gladness fed with secret tears, A vexing, forward-reaching sense</p>

<p>I382 JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>Of some more noble permanence; A light across the sea, Which haunts the soul and will not let it be, Still beaconing from the heights of undegenerate years.</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>Whither leads the path To ampler fates that leads? Not down through flowery meads, To reap an aftermath Of youth's vainglorious weeds, But up the steep, amid the wrath And shock of deadly-hostile creeds, Where the world's best hope and stay By battle's flashes gropes a desperate way, And every turf the fierce foot clings to bleeds. Peace hath her not ignoble wreath, Ere yet the sharp, decisive word Light the black lips of cannon, and the sword</p>

<p>Dreams in its easeful sheath; But some day the live coal behind the thought, Whether from Baal's stone obscene, Or from the shrine serene Of God's pure altar brought, Bursts up in flame; the war of tongue and pen Learns with what deadly purpose it was fraught, And, helpless in the fiery passion caught, Shakes all the pillared state with shock of men: Some day the soft Ideal that we wooed Confronts us fiercely, foe-beset, pursued, And cries reproachful: ' Was it, then, my praise, And not myself was loved? Prove now thy truth; I claim of thee the promise of thy youth; Give me thy life, or cower in empty phrase, The victim of thy genius, not its mate!' Life may be given in many ways, And loyalty to Truth be sealed As bravely in the closet as the field, So bountiful is Fate;</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL 1383</p>

<p>But then to stand beside her,</p>

<p>When craven churls deride her, To front a lie in arms and not to yield,</p>

<p>This shows, methinks, God's plan</p>

<p>And measure of a stalwart man,</p>

<p>Limbed like the old heroic breeds,</p>

<p>Who stands self-poised on manhood's solid earth, Not forced to frame excuses for his birth, Fed from within with all the strength he needs.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>Such was he, our Martyr-Chief,</p>

<p>Whom late the Nation he had led,</p>

<p>With ashes on her head, Wept with the passion of an angry grief: Forgive me, if from present things I turn To speak what in my heart will beat and burn, And hang my wreath on his world-honored urn.</p>

<p>Nature, they say, doth dote,</p>

<p>And cannot make a man</p>

<p>Save on some worn-out plan,</p>

<p>Repeating us by rote: For him her Old-World moulds aside she threw,</p>

<p>And choosing sweet clay from the breast</p>

<p>Of the unexhausted West, With stuff untainted shaped a hero new, Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true.</p>

<p>How beautiful to see Once more a shepherd of mankind indeed, Who loved his charge, but never loved to lead; One whose meek flock the people joyed to be,</p>

<p>Not lured by any cheat of birth,</p>

<p>But by his clear-grained human worth, And brave old wisdom of sincerity!</p>

<p>They knew that outward grace is dust;</p>

<p>They could not choose but trust In that sure-footed mind's unfaltering skill,</p>

<p>And supple-tempered will That bent like perfect steel to spring again and thrust.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>vn</p>

<p>Long as man's hope insatiate can discern Or only guess some more inspiring goal Outside of Self, enduring as the pole, Along whose course the flying axles burn Of spirits bravely-pitched, earth's manlier brood;</p>

<p>Long as below we cannot find The meed that stills the inexorable mind;</p>

<p>His was no lonely mountain-peak of mind, Thrusting to thin air o'er our cloudy bars, A sea-mark now, now lost in vapors blind; Broad prairie rather, genial, level-lined, Fruitful and friendly for all human kind, Yet also nigh to heaven and loved of loftiest stars.</p>

<p>Nothing of Europe here, Or, then, of Europe fronting mornward still, Ere any names of Serf and Peer Could Nature's equal scheme deface And thwart her genial will; Here was a type of the true elder race, And one of Plutarch's men talked with us face to face.</p>

<p>I praise him not; it were too late; And some innative weakness there must be In him who condescends to victory Such as the Present gives, and cannot wait, Safe in himself as in a fate. So always firmly he: He knew to bide his time, And can his fame abide, Still patient in his simple faith sublime, Till the wise years decide. Great captains, with their guns and drums, Disturb our judgment for the hour, But at last silence comes; These all are gone, and, standing like a tower, Our children shall behold his fame.</p>

<p>The kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man, Sagacious, patient, dreading praise, not blame, New birth of our new soil, the first American.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>So long this faith to some ideal Good, Under whatever mortal names it masks, Freedom, Law, Country, this ethereal mood</p>

<p>That thanks the Fates for their severer tasks, Feeling its challenged pulses leap, While others skulk in subterfuges cheap,</p>

<p>And, set in Danger's van, has all the boon it asks, Shall win man's praise and woman's love, Shall be a wisdom that we set above</p>

<p>All other skills and gifts to culture dear,</p>

<p>A virtue round whose forehead we inwreathe Laurels that with a living passion breathe</p>

<p>When other crowns grow, while we twine them, sear What brings us thronging these high rites to pay,</p>

<p>And seal these hours the noblest of our year, Save that our brothers found this better way?</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>We sit here in the Promised Land That flows with Freedom's honey and milk; But 'twas they won it, sword in hand, Making the nettle danger soft for us as silk. We welcome back our bravest and our best; Ah me! not all! some come not with the rest, Who went forth brave and bright as any here! I strive to mix some gladness with my strain, But the sad strings complain, And will not please the ear: I sweep them for a pa^an, but they wane</p>

<p>Again and yet again Into a dirge, and die away, in pain. In these brave ranks I only see the gaps, Thinking of dear ones whom the dumb turf wraps, Dark to the triumph which they died to gain: Fidier may others greet the living, For me the past is unforgiving; I with uncovered head Salute the sacred dead, Who went, and who return not.Say not so! 'Tis not the grapes of Canaan that repay,</p>

<p>I386 , JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>But the high faith that failed not by the way; Virtue treads paths that end not in the grave; No ban of endless night exiles the brave;</p>

<p>And to the saner mind We rather seem the dead that stayed behind. Blow, trumpets, all your exultations blow! For never shall their aureoled presence lack: I see them muster in a gleaming row, With ever-youthful brows that nobler show; We find in our dull road their shining track;</p>

<p>In every nobler mood We feel the orient of their spirit glow, Part of our life's unalterable good, Of all our saintlier aspiration;</p>

<p>They come transfigured back, Secure from change in their high-hearted ways, Beautiful evermore, and with the rays Of morn on their white Shields of Expectation!</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>But is there hope to save Even this ethereal essence from the grave ? What ever 'scaped Oblivion's subtle wrong</p>

<p>Save a few clarion names, or golden threads of song? Before my musing eye The mighty ones of old sweep by, Disvoiced now and insubstantial things, As noisy once as we; poor ghosts of kings, Shadows of empire wholly gone to dust, And many races, nameless long ago, To darkness driven by that imperious gust Of ever-rushing Time that here doth blow: O visionary world, condition strange, Where naught abiding is but only Change,</p>

<p>Where the deep-bolted stars themselves still shift and range! Shall we to more continuance make pretence?</p>

<p>Renown builds tombs; a life-estate is Wit; And, bit by bit,</p>

<p>The cunning years steal all from us but woe; Leaves are we, whose decays no harvest sow.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL I387</p>

<p>But, when we vanish hence, Shall they lie forceless in the dark below Save to make green their little length of sods, Or deepen pansies for a year or two, Who now to us are shining-sweet as gods? Was dying all they had the skill to do? That were not fruitless: but the Soul resents Such short-lived service, as if blind events Ruled without her, or earth could so endure; She claims a more divine investiture Of longer tenure than Fame's airy rents; Whate'er she touches doth her nature share; Her inspiration haunts the ennobled air,</p>

<p>Gives eyes to mountains blind, Ears to the deaf earth, voices to the wind, And her clear trump sings succor everywhere By lonely bivouacs to the wakeful mind; For soul inherits all that soul could dare:</p>

<p>Yea, Manhood hath a wider span And larger privilege of life than man. The single deed, the private sacrifice, So radiant now through proudly-hidden tears, Is covered up erelong from mortal eyes With thoughdess drift of the deciduous years; But that high privilege that makes all men peers, That leap of heart whereby a people rise</p>

<p>Up to a noble anger's height, And, flamed on by the Fates, not shrink, but grow more That swift validity in noble veins, [bright,</p>

<p>Of choosing danger and disdaining shame,</p>

<p>Of being set on flame By the pure fire that flies all contact base But wraps its chosen with angelic might,</p>

<p>These are imperishable gains, Sure as the sun, medicinal as light, These hold great futures in their lusty reins And certify to earth a new imperial race.</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</p>

<p>Who now shall sneer?</p>

<p>Who dare again to say we trace</p>

<p>Our lines to a plebeian race? Roundhead and Cavalier! Dumb are those names erewhile in battle loud; Dream-footed as the shadow of a cloud,</p>

<p>They flit across the ear: That is best blood that hath most iron in't, To edge resolve with, pouring without stint</p>

<p>For what makes manhood dear.</p>

<p>Tell us not of Plantagenets, Hapsburgs, and Guelfs, whose thin bloods crawl Down from some victor in a border-brawl!</p>

<p>How poor their outworn coronets, Matched with one leaf of that plain civic wreath Our brave for honor's blazon shall bequeath,</p>

<p>Through whose desert a rescued Nation sets Her heel on treason, and the trumpet hears Shout victory, tingling Europe's sullen ears With vain resentments and more vain regrets I</p>

<p>Not in anger, not in pride,</p>

<p>Pure from passion's mixture rude</p>

<p>Ever to base earth allied,</p>

<p>But with far-heard gratitude,</p>

<p>Still with heart and voice renewed, To heroes living and dear martyrs dead, The strain should close that consecrates our brave! Lift the heart and lift the head!</p>

<p>Lofty be its mood and grave,</p>

<p>Not without a martial ring,</p>

<p>Not without a prouder tread</p>

<p>And a peal of exultation:</p>

<p>Little right has he to sing</p>

<p>Through whose heart in such an hour</p>

<p>Beats no march of conscious power,</p>

<p>Sweeps no tumult of elation!</p>

<p>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL 1389</p>

<p>Tis no Man we celebrate,</p>

<p>By his country's victories great,</p>

<p>A hero half, and half the whim of Fate,</p>

<p>But the pith and marrow of a Nation</p>

<p>Drawing force from all her men,</p>

<p>Highest, humblest, weakest, all,</p>

<p>For her time of need, and then</p>

<p>Pulsing it again through them, Till the basest can no longer cower, Feeling his soul spring up divinely tall, Touched but in passing by her mande-hem. Come back, then, noble pride, for 'tis her dowerl</p>

<p>How could poet ever tower,</p>

<p>If his passions, hopes, and fears,</p>

<p>If his triumphs and his tears,</p>

<p>Kept not measure with his people? Boom, cannon, boom to all the winds and waves! Clash out, glad bells, from every rocking steeple! Banners, advance with triumph, bend your staves!</p>

<p>And from every mountain-peak</p>

<p>Let beacon-fire to answering beacon speak,</p>

<p>Katahdin tell Monadnock, Whiteface he, And so leap on in light from sea to sea, Till the glad news be sent Across a kindling continent, Making earth feel more firm and air breathe braver: 'Be proud! for she is saved, and all have helped to save her!</p>

<p>She that lifts up the manhood of the poor,</p>

<p>She of the open soul and open door,</p>

<p>With room about her hearth for all mankind!</p>

<p>The fire is dreadful in her eyes no more;</p>

<p>From her bold front the helm she doth unbind,</p>

<p>Sends all her handmaid armies back to spin,</p>

<p>And bids her navies, that so lately hurled</p>

<p>Their crashing battle, hold their thunders in,</p>

<p>Swimming like birds of calm along the unharmful shore.</p>

<p>No challenge sends she to the elder world,</p>

<p>That looked askance and hated; a light scorn</p>

<p>Plays o'er her mouth, as round her mighty knees</p>

<p>She calls her children back, and waits the morn Of nobler day, enthroned between her subject seas.'</p>

<p>Bow down, dear Land, for thou hast found release!</p>

<p>Thy God, in these distempered days,</p>

<p>Hath taught thee the sure wisdom of His ways, And through thine enemies hath wrought thy peace!</p>

<p>Bow down in prayer and praise! No poorest in thy borders but may now Lift to the juster skies a man's enfranchised brow. O Beautiful! my country! ours once more! Smoothing thy gold of war-dishevelled hair O'er such sweet brows as never other wore,</p>

<p>And letting thy set lips,</p>

<p>Freed from wrath's pale eclipse, The rosy edges of their smile lay bare, What words divine of lover or of poet Could tell our love and make thee know it, Among the Nations bright beyond compare?</p>

<p>What were our lives without thee?</p>

<p>What all our lives to save thee?</p>

<p>We reck not what we gave thee;</p>

<p>We will not dare to doubt thee, But ask whatever else, and we will dare!</p>

<p>809 The Marshes of Glynn</p>

<p>Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven With intricate shades of the vines that myriad-cloven Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs, Emerald twilights, Virginal shy lights, Wrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows, When lovers pace timidly down through the green colonnades Of the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods,</p>

<p>Of the heavenly woods and glades, That run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within The wide sea-marshes of Glynn;</p>

<p>From Poems of Sidney Lanier. Copyright, 1884, 1891, by Mary D. Lanier. Published by Charles Scribner's Sons.</p>

<p>SIDNEY LANIER 139I</p>

<p>Beautiful glooms, soft dusks in the noonday fire, Wildwood privacies, closets of lone desire, Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves, Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves, Pure with a sense of the passing of saints through the wood, Cool for the dutiful weighing of ill with good;</p>

<p>O braided dusks of the oak and woven shades of the vine, While the riotous noon-day sun of the June day long did shine Ye held me fast in your heart and I held you fast in mine; But now when the noon is no more, and riot is rest, And the sun is a-wait at the ponderous gate of the West, And the slant yellow beam down the wood-aisle doth seem Like a lane into heaven that leads from a dream, Ay, now, when my soul all day hath drunken the soul of the oak, And my heart is at ease from men, and the wearisome sound of the stroke</p>

<p>Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low, And belief overmasters doubt, and I know that I know, And my spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within, That the length and the breadth and the sweep of the Marshes of Glynn</p>

<p>Will work me no fear like the fear they have wrought me of yore When length was fatigue, and when breadth was but bitterness sore,</p>

<p>And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain,</p>

<p>Oh, now, unafraid, I am fain to face</p>

<p>The vast sweet visage of space. To the edge of the wood I am drawn, I am drawn, Where the gray beach glimmering runs, as a belt of the dawn, For a mete and a mark To the forest-dark: So:</p>

<p>Affable live-oak, leaning low, Thuswith your favorsoft, with a reverent hand (Not lightly touching your person, Lord of the land!), Bending your beauty aside, with a step I stand On the firm-packed sand, Free</p>

<p>1392 SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea.</p>

<p>Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band Of the sand-beach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land.</p>

<p>Inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl</p>

<p>As a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows the firm</p>

<p>sweet limbs of a girl. Vanishing, swerving, evermore curving again into sight, Softly the sand-beach wavers away to a dim gray looping of light.</p>

<p>And what if behind me to westward the wall of the woods stands high?</p>

<p>The world lies east: how ample, the marsh and the sea and the sky! A league and a league of marsh-grass, waist-high, broad in the blade,</p>

<p>Green, and all of a height, and unflecked with a light or a shade, Stretch leisurely off, in a pleasant plain, To the terminal blue of the main.</p>

<p>Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea?</p>

<p>Somehow my soul seems suddenly free From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin, By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn.</p>

<p>Ye marshes, how candid and simple and nothing-withholding and free</p>

<p>Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea! Tolerant plains, that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun, Ye spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain And sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain.</p>

<p>As the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod,</p>

<p>Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God:</p>

<p>I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies</p>

<p>In the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt the marsh and the skies:</p>

<p>By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod</p>

<p>I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God:</p>

<p>Oh, like to the greatness of God is the greatness within</p>

<p>SIDNEY LANIER 1393</p>

<p>The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn. And the sea lends large, as the marsh: lo, out of his plenty the sea Pours fast: full soon the time of the flood-tide must be: Look how the grace of the sea doth go About and about through the intricate channels that flow Here and there, Everywhere,</p>

<p>Till his waters have flooded the uttermost creeks and the low-lying lanes,</p>

<p>And the marsh is meshed with a million veins, That like as with rosy and silvery essences flow In the rose-and-silver evening glow. Farewell, my lord Sun! The creeks overflow: a thousand rivulets run; 'Twixt the roots of the sod; the blades of the marsh-grass stir; Passeth a hurrying sound of wings that westward whirr; Passeth, and all is still; and the currents cease to run, And the sea and the marsh are one.</p>

<p>How still the plains of the waters be! The tide is in his ecstasy. The tide is at his highest height: And it is night.</p>

<p>And now from the Vast of the Lord will the waters of sleep</p>

<p>Roll in on the souls of men,</p>

<p>But who will reveal to our waking ken</p>

<p>The forms that swim and the shapes that creep</p>

<p>Under the waters of sleep? And I would I could know what swimmeth below when the tide comes in</p>

<p>On the length and the breadth of the marvellous marshes of Glynn.</p>

<p>810 The Revenge of Hamish</p>

<p>It was three slim does and a ten-tined buck in the bracken lay;</p>

<p>And all of a sudden the sinister smell of a man,</p>

<p>Awaft on a wind-shift, wavered and ran Down the hillside and sifted along through the bracken and passed that way.</p>

<p>From Poems of Sidney Lanier. Copyright, 1884, 1891, by Mary D. Lanier. Published by Charles Scribner's Sons.</p>

<p>1394 SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>Then Nan got a-tremble at nostril; she was the daintiest doe;</p>

<p>In the print of her velvet flank on the velvet fern</p>

<p>She reared, and rounded her ears in turn. Then the buck leapt up, and his head as a king's to a crown did go</p>

<p>Full high in the breeze, and he stood as if Death had the form of a deer;</p>

<p>And the two slim does long lazily stretching arose, For their day-dream slowlier came to a close, Till they woke and were still, breath-bound with waiting and wonder and fear.</p>

<p>Then Alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock, the hounds shot by,</p>

<p>The does and the ten-tined buck made a marvellous bound, The hounds swept after with never a sound, But Alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh.</p>

<p>For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild,</p>

<p>And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds For to drive him the deer to the lower glen-grounds: 'I will kill a red deer,' quoth Maclean, 'in the sight of the wife and the child.'</p>

<p>So gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand; But he hurried tall Hamish the henchman ahead: 'Go turn,' Cried Maclean,'if the deer seek to cross to the burn,</p>

<p>Do thou turn them to me: nor fail, lest thy back be red as thy hand.'</p>

<p>Now hard-fortuned Hamish, half blown of his breath with the height of the hill, Was white in the face when the ten-tined buck and the does Drew leaping to burn-ward; huskily rose His shouts, and his nether lip twitched, and his legs were o'er-weak for his will.</p>

<p>So the deer darted lightly by Hamish and bounded away to the burn.</p>

<p>But Maclean never bating his watch tarried waiting below;</p>

<p>SIDNEY LANIER 1395</p>

<p>Still Hamish hung heavy with fear for to go All the space of an hour, then he went, and his face was greenish and stern,</p>

<p>And his eye sat back in the socket, and shrunken the eyeballs shone, As withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see. 'Now, now, grim henchman, what is't with thee?'</p>

<p>Brake Maclean, and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown.</p>

<p>'Three does and a ten-tined buck made out,' spoke Hamish, full mild,</p>

<p>'And I ran for to turn, but my breath it was blown, and they passed;</p>

<p>I was weak, for ye called ere I broke me my fast.' Cried Maclean: 'Now a ten-tined buck in the sight of the wife and the child</p>

<p>'I had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me a snail's own wrong!'</p>

<p>Then he sounded, and down came kinsmen and clansmen all: 'Ten blows, for ten tine, on his back let fall, And reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong!'</p>

<p>So Hamish made bare, and took him his strokes; at the last he smiled.</p>

<p>'Now I'll to the burn,' quoth Maclean, 'for it still may be, If a slimmer-paunched henchman will hurry with me, I shall kill me the ten-tined buck for a gift to the wife and the child!'</p>

<p>Then the clansmen departed, by this path and that; and over the hill</p>

<p>Sped Maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame; And that place of the lashing full quiet became; And the wife and the child stood sad; and bloody-backed Hamish sat still.</p>

<p>But look! red Hamish has risen; quick about and about turns he. 'There is none betwixt me and the crag-top!' he screams under breath.</p>

<p>1396 SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>Then, livid as Lazarus lately from death, He snatches the child from the mother, and clambers the crag toward the sea.</p>

<p>Now the mother drops breath; she is dumb, and her heart goes dead for a space, Till the motherhood, mistress of death, shrieks, shrieks through the glen,</p>

<p>And that place of the lashing is live with men, And Maclean, and the gillie that told him, dash up in a desperate race.</p>

<p>Not a breath's time for asking; an eye-glance reveals all the tale untold.</p>

<p>They follow mad Hamish afar up the crag toward the sea, And the lady cries: 'Clansmen, run for a fee! Yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold</p>

<p>'Fast Hamish back from the brink!'and ever she flies up the steep, And the clansmen pant, and they sweat, and they jostle and strain.</p>

<p>But, mother, 'tis vain; but, father, 'tis vain; Stern Hamish stands bold on the brink, and dangles the child o'er the deep.</p>

<p>Now a faintness falls on the men that run, and they all stand still. And the wife prays Hamish as if he were God, on her knees, Crying: 'Hamish! O Hamish! but please, but please</p>

<p>For to spare him!' and Hamish still dangles the child, with a wavering will.</p>

<p>On a sudden he turns; with a sea-hawk scream, and a gibe, and a song,</p>

<p>Cries: 'So; I will spare ye the child if, in sight of ye all, Ten blows on Maclean's bare back shall fall, And ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong!"</p>

<p>Then Maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red,</p>

<p>Breathed short for a space, said: 'Nay, but it never shall be!</p>

<p>SIDNEY LANIER 1397</p>

<p>Let me hurl oft the damnable hound in the sea!' But the wife: 'Can Hamish go fish us the child from the sea, if dead?</p>

<p>'Say yea!Let them lash me, Hamish?''Nay!''Husband, the lashing will heal; But, oh, who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave? Could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave? Quick! Love! I will bare theesokneel!' Then Maclean 'gan slowly to kneel</p>

<p>With never a word, till presently downward he jerked to the earth. Then the henchmanhe that smote Hamishwould tremble and lag;</p>

<p>'Strike, hard!' quoth Hamish, full stern, from the crag; Then he struck him, and 'One!' sang Hamish, and danced with the child in his mirth.</p>

<p>And no man spake beside Hamish; he counted each stroke with a song.</p>

<p>When the last stroke fell, then he moved him a pace down the height,</p>

<p>And he held forth the child in the heart-aching sight Of the mother, and looked all pitiful grave, as repenting a wrong.</p>

<p>And there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayer</p>

<p>And there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace, Till her finger nigh felt of the bairnie's face In a flash fierce Hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air,</p>

<p>And sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea,</p>

<p>Shrill screeching, 'Revenge!' in the wind-rush; and pallid Maclean,</p>

<p>Age-feeble with anger and impotent pain, Crawled up on the crag, and lay flat, and locked hold of dead roots of a tree,</p>

<p>I398 SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>And gazed hungrily o'er, and the blood from his back drip-dripped in the brine,</p>

<p>And a sea-hawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew, And the mother stared white on the waste of blue, And the wind drove a cloud to seaward, and the sun began to shine.</p>

<p>811 How Love Looked for Hell</p>

<p>To heal his heart of long-time pain</p>

<p>One day Prince Love for to travel was fain</p>

<p>With Ministers Mind and Sense. 'Now what to thee most strange may be?' Quoth Mind and Sense. 'All things above, One curious thing I first would see</p>

<p>Hell,' quoth Love.</p>

<p>Then Mind rode in and Sense rode out: They searched the ways of man about.</p>

<p>First frightfully groaneth Sense. ' 'Tis here, 'tis here,' and spurreth in fear To the top of the hill that hangeth above And plucketh the Prince: 'Come, come, 'tis here'</p>

<p>'Where?' quoth Love</p>

<p>'Not far, not far,' said shivering Sense As they rode on. 'A short way hence,</p>

<p>But seventy paces hence: Look, King, dost see where suddenly This road doth dip from the height above? Cold blew a mouldy wind by me'</p>

<p>('Cold?' quoth Love)</p>

<p>'As I rode down, and the River was black, And yon-side, lo! an endless wrack</p>

<p>And rabble of souls,' sighed Sense, 'Their eyes upturned and begged and burned In brimstone lakes, and a Hand above Beat back the hands that upward yearned'</p>

<p>'Nay!' quoth Love</p>

<p>From Poems of Sidney Lanier. Copyright, 1884, 1891, by Mary D. Lanier. Published by Charles Scribner's Sons.</p>

<p>SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>1399</p>

<p>'Yea, yea, sweet Prince; thyself shalt see, Wilt thou but down this slope with me;</p>

<p>'Tis palpable,' whispered Sense. At the foot of the hill a living rill Shone, and the lilies shone white above; 'But now 'twas black, 'twas a river, this rill,'</p>

<p>('Black?' quoth Love)</p>

<p>'Ay, black, but lo! the lilies grow,</p>

<p>And yon-side where was woe, was woe,</p>

<p>Where the rabble of souls,' cried Sense, 'Did shrivel and turn and beg and burn, Thrust back in the brimstone from above Is banked of violet, rose, and fern:'</p>

<p>'How?' quoth Love:</p>

<p>'For lakes of pain, yon pleasant plain Of woods and grass and yellow grain</p>

<p>Doth ravish the soul and sense: And never a sigh beneath the sky, And folk that smile and gaze above' 'But saw'st thou here, with thine own eye,</p>

<p>Hell?' quoth Love.</p>

<p>'I saw true hell with mine own eye, True hell, or light hath told a lie,</p>

<p>True, verily,' quoth stout Sense. Then Love rode round and searched the ground, The caves below, the hills above; 'But I cannot find where thou hast found</p>

<p>Hell,' quoth Love.</p>

<p>There, while they stood in a green wood And marvelled still on 111 and Good,</p>

<p>Came suddenly Minister Mind. 'In the heart of sin doth hell begin: 'Tis not below, 'tis not above, It lieth within, it lieth within:'</p>

<p>('Where?' quoth Love)</p>

<p>I4OO SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>'I saw a man sit by a corse;</p>

<p>Hell's in the murderer's breast: remorse!</p>

<p>Thus clamored his mind to his mind: Not fleshly dole is the sinner's goal, Hell's not below, nor yet above, 'Tis fixed in the ever-damned soul'</p>

<p>'Fixed?' quoth Love</p>

<p>'Fixed: follow me, would'st thou but see: He weepeth under yon willow tree,</p>

<p>Fast chained to his corse,' quoth Mind. Full soon they passed, for they rode fast, Where the piteous willow bent above. 'Now shall I see at last, at last,</p>

<p>Hell,' quoth Love.</p>

<p>There when they came Mind suffered shame: 'These be the same and not the same,'</p>

<p>A-wondering whispered Mind. Lo, face by face two spirits pace Where the blissful willow waves above: One saith: 'Do me a friendly grace'</p>

<p>('Grace!' quoth Love)</p>

<p>'Read me two Dreams that linger long, Dim as returns of old-time song</p>

<p>That flicker about the mind. I dreamed (how deep in mortal sleep!) I struck thee dead, then stood above, With tears that none but dreamers weep;'</p>

<p>'Dreams,' quoth Love;</p>

<p>'In dreams, again, I plucked a flower</p>

<p>That clung with pain and stung with power,</p>

<p>Yea, nettled me, body and mind.' ' 'Twas the nettle of sin, 'twas medicine; No need nor seed of it here Above; In dreams of hate true loves begin.'</p>

<p>'True,' quoth Love.</p>

<p>812 The Reveille</p>

<p>Hark 11 hear the tramp of thousands,</p>

<p>And of armed men the hum; Lo! a nation's hosts have gathered Round the quick alarming drum, Saying, 'Come, Freemen, come! Ere your heritage be wasted,' said the quick alarming drum.</p>

<p>Let me of my heart take counsel:</p>

<p>War is not of life the sum; Who shall stay and reap the harvest When the autumn days shall come? But the drum Echoed, 'Come!</p>

<p>Death shall reap the braver harvest,' said the solemn-sounding drum.</p>

<p>'But when won the coming battle, What of profit springs therefrom ? What if conquest, subjugation, Even greater ills become?' But the drum Answered, 'Come! You must do the sum to prove it,' said the Yankee-answering drum.</p>

<p>'What if, 'mid cannons' thunder, Whistling shot and bursting bomb,</p>

<p>'Now strange,' quoth Sense, and 'Strange,' quoth Mind,</p>

<p>'We saw it, and yet 'tis hard to find,</p>

<p>But we saw it,' quoth Sense and Mind.</p>

<p>Stretched on the ground, beautiful-crowned</p>

<p>Of the piteous willow that wreathed above,</p>

<p>'But I cannot find where ye have found Hell,' quoth Love.</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p>When my brothers fall around me,</p>

<p>Should my heart grow cold and numb?' But the drum Answered, 'Come! Better there in death united, than in life a recreant,Come!'</p>

<p>Thus they answered,hoping, fearing,</p>

<p>Some in faith, and doubting some, Till a trumpet-voice proclaiming, Said, 'My chosen people, come!' Then the drum, Lo! was dumb.</p>

<p>For the great heart of the nation, throbbing, answered, 'Lord, we come!'</p>

<p>One's-self I sing, a simple separate person,</p>

<p>Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.</p>

<p>Of physiology from top to toe I sing,</p>

<p>Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse</p>

<p>I say the Form complete is worthier far, The Female equally with the Male I sing.</p>

<p>Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,</p>

<p>Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my way,</p>

<p>Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of</p>

<p>responding kisses (never again on earth responding), Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate</p>

<p>night-wind,</p>

<p>Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading,</p>

<p>Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night, But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed. Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands,</p>

<p>Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comradenot a tear, not a word.</p>

<p>I404 WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p>All the past we leave behind, We debouch upon a newer mightier world, varied world,</p>

<p>Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier, As onward silendy stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole, Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death, I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,)</p>

<p>Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd, My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form, Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet,</p>

<p>And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in</p>

<p>his rude-dug grave I deposited, Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battlefield dim, Vigil for boy of responding kisses (never again on earth responding), Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten'd, I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket, And buried him where he fell.</p>

<p>8/7 Ethiopia Saluting the Colors</p>

<p>Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,</p>

<p>With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet?</p>

<p>Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?</p>

<p>('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines, Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to me, As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)</p>

<p>Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder'd, A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught, Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought.</p>

<p>I408 WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p>No further does she say, but lingering all the day,</p>

<p>Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,</p>

<p>And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.</p>

<p>What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?</p>

<p>Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?</p>

<p>Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen?</p>

<p>818 The Wound-Dresser</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>An old man bending I come among new faces, Years looking backward resuming in answer to children, Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me, (Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,</p>

<p>But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself, To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;) Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances, Of unsurpass'd heroes (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)</p>

<p>Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,</p>

<p>Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us ?</p>

<p>What stays with you latest and deepest ? of curious panics,</p>

<p>Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>O maidens and young men I love and that love me, What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,</p>

<p>Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust, In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush</p>

<p>of successful charge, Enter the captur'd worksyet lo, like a swift-running river they fade, Pass and are gone they fadeI dwell not on soldiers' perils or soldiers'</p>

<p>joys</p>

<p>(Both I remember wellmany the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content).</p>

<p>But in silence, in dreams' projections,</p>

<p>While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN 1409</p>

<p>So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand, With hinged knees returning I enter the doors (while for you up there, Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart).</p>

<p>Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,</p>

<p>Straight and swift to my wounded I go,</p>

<p>Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,</p>

<p>Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground,</p>

<p>Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,</p>

<p>To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,</p>

<p>To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,</p>

<p>An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,</p>

<p>Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd again.</p>

<p>I onward go, I stop,</p>

<p>With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds, I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable, One turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy! I never knew you, Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!) The crush'd head I dress (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away), The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I examine,</p>

<p>Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life struggles hard</p>

<p>(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death! In mercy come quickly).</p>

<p>From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,</p>

<p>I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood, Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side-falling head,</p>

<p>His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody stump, And has not yet look'd on it.</p>

<p>I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,</p>

<p>But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking, And the yellow-blue countenance see.</p>

<p>1410 WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p>I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound, Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive,</p>

<p>While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail. I am faithful, I do not give out,</p>

<p>The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen, These and more I dress with impassive hand (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame).</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Thus in silence in dreams' projections,</p>

<p>Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,</p>

<p>The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,</p>

<p>I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,</p>

<p>Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,</p>

<p>(Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,</p>

<p>Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips).</p>

<p>Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling, Give me juicy autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard, Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows, Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,</p>

<p>Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching content,</p>

<p>Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the Mississippi,</p>

<p>and I looking up at the stars, Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can</p>

<p>walk undisturb'd,</p>

<p>Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman of whom I should never tire,</p>

<p>Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the world</p>

<p>a rural domestic life, Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own ears</p>

<p>only,</p>

<p>Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal sanities!</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN I4II</p>

<p>These demanding to have them (tired with ceaseless excitement, and</p>

<p>It is some dream that on the deck, You've fallen cold and dead.</p>

<p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; Exult O shores, and ring O bells! But I with mournful tread,</p>

<p>And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,</p>

<p>A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.</p>

<p>Song of the bleeding throat,</p>

<p>Death's outlet song of life (for well dear brother I know, If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die).</p>

<p>Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd from</p>

<p>the ground, spotting the gray debris, Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless</p>

<p>grass,</p>

<p>Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the</p>

<p>dark-brown fields uprisen, Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards, Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, Night and day journeys a coffin.</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land, With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black, With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women standing, With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night, With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads,</p>

<p>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn,</p>

<p>With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin, The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organswhere amid these you journey,</p>

<p>With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang, Here, coffin that slowly passes, I give you my sprig of lilac.</p>

<p>O western orb sailing the heaven,</p>

<p>Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk'd, As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night, As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night, As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side (while the other</p>

<p>stars all look'd on), As we wander'd together the solemn night (for something I know not</p>

<p>what kept me from sleep),</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN I415</p>

<p>As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe,</p>

<p>As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,</p>

<p>As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of the night,</p>

<p>As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.</p>

<p>Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there</p>

<p>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,</p>

<p>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun,</p>

<p>Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices</p>

<p>of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd, And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with</p>

<p>And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its</p>

<p>Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,</p>

<p>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,</p>

<p>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,</p>

<p>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.</p>

<p>And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,</p>

<p>And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.</p>

<p>From deep secluded recesses,</p>

<p>From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, Came the carol of the bird.</p>

<p>And the charm of the carol rapt me,</p>

<p>As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,</p>

<p>And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.</p>

<p>Come lovely and soothing death,</p>

<p>Over the dense-pacl(d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways, I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.</p>

<p>15</p>

<p>To the tally of my soul,</p>

<p>Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,</p>

<p>With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.</p>

<p>Loud in the pines and cedars dim,</p>

<p>Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp perfume,</p>

<p>And I with my comrades there in the night.</p>

<p>While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, As to long panoramas of visions.</p>

<p>And I saw askant the armies,</p>

<p>I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags, Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw them,</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN I419</p>

<p>And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody, And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence), And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.</p>

<p>I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,</p>

<p>And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,</p>

<p>I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,</p>

<p>But I saw they were not as was thought,</p>

<p>They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,</p>

<p>The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,</p>

<p>And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,</p>

<p>And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.</p>

<p>16</p>

<p>Passing the visions, passing the night, Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands, Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song, As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,</p>

<p>Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again</p>

<p>bursting with joy, Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven, As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves, I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.</p>

<p>I cease from my song for thee,</p>

<p>From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,</p>

<p>O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.</p>

<p>Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night, The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul, With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird, Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well,</p>

<p>1420 WALT WHITMAN</p>

<p>For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and landsand this for his dear sake,</p>

<p>Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.</p>

<p>822 Prayer of Columbus</p>

<p>A batter'd, wreck'd old man</p>

<p>Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,</p>

<p>Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,</p>

<p>Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd and nigh to death,</p>

<p>I take my way along the island's edge,</p>

<p>Venting a heavy heart.</p>

<p>I am too full of woe!</p>

<p>Haply I may not live another day;</p>

<p>I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink or sleep,</p>

<p>Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,</p>

<p>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune with Thee,</p>

<p>Report myself once more to Thee.</p>

<p>Thou knowest my years entire, my life,</p>

<p>My long and crowded life of active work, not adoration merely; Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth, Thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary meditations, Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to Thee, Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly kept them, Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee, In shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not, Accepting all from Thee, as duly come from Thee.</p>

<p>All my emprises have been fill'd with Thee,</p>

<p>My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee,</p>

<p>Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;</p>

<p>Intentions, purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to Thee.</p>

<p>O I am sure they really came from Thee,</p>

<p>The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,</p>

<p>The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,</p>

<p>A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,</p>

<p>These sped me on.</p>

<p>WALT WHITMAN 1421</p>

<p>By me and these the work so far accomplish'd,</p>

<p>By me earth's elder cloy'd and stifled lands uncloy'd, unloos'd,</p>

<p>By me the hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the known.</p>

<p>The end I know not, it is all in Thee,</p>

<p>Or small or great I know nothaply what broad fields, what lands, Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know, Transplanted there may rise to stature, knowledge worthy Thee, Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn'd to reaping-tools, Haply the lifeless cross I know, Europe's dead cross, may bud and blossom there.</p>

<p>One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;</p>

<p>That Thou O God my life hast lighted,</p>

<p>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,</p>

<p>Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,</p>

<p>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages;</p>

<p>For that O God, be it my latest word, here on my knees,</p>

<p>Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank Thee.</p>

<p>My terminus near,</p>

<p>The clouds already closing in upon me, The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost, I yield my ships to Thee.</p>

<p>My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,</p>

<p>My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd,</p>

<p>Let the old timbers part, I will not part,</p>

<p>I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,</p>

<p>Thee, Thee at least I know.</p>

<p>Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving? What do I know of life? what of myself? I know not even my own work past or present, Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me, Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition, Mocking, perplexing me.</p>

<p>And these things I see suddenly, what mean they ?</p>

<p>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes,</p>

<p>1422 walt whitman</p>

<p>Let me glide noiselessly forth;</p>

<p>With the key of softness unlock the lockswith a whisper, Set ope the doors O soul.</p>

<p>Tenderlybe not impatient, (Strong is your hold O mortal flesh. Strong is your hold O love).</p>

<p>Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky, And on the distant waves sail countless ships, And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.</p>

<p>82J The Last Invocation</p>

<p>At the last, tenderly,</p>

<p>From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house,</p>

<p>From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed</p>

<p>doors, Let me be wafted.</p>
