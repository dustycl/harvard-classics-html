<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The name Confucius is the Latinized form of the Chinese characters, K'ung Foo-tsze, meaning "The master, K'ung." The bearer of this name was born of an ancient and distinguished family in the district of Tsow, in the present province of Shentung, China, B. C. 551. His father was a soldier of reputation and governor of Tsow, but not a man of wealth. Confucius married at nineteen, and in his early manhood held a minor office; but within a few years he became a public teacher, and soon attracted numerous disciples. Rising in reputation, he was invited to the court of Chow, where he investigated the traditional ceremonies and maxims of the ruling dynasty; and in the following year visited another state where he studied the ancient music. When he was nearly fifty, in the year 500 B. C, he again took office, becoming in turn chief magistrate of the town of Chung-too, Assistant-Superintendent of Works to the Ruler of Loo, and finally Minister of Crime. In spite of almost miraculous efficiency, he lost the support of his ruler in 496 B. C; and until his death in 478 B. C, he wandered from state to state, sometimes well-treated, sometimes enduring severe hardships, always saddened by the refusal of the turbulent potentates to be guided by his beneficent counsels. No sooner was he dead, however, than his wisdom was recognized by peasant and emperor alike; admiration rose to veneration, veneration to worship. Sacrifices were offered to him, temples built in his honor, and a cult established which has lasted almost two thousand years.</p>

<p>Confucius did not regard himself as an innovator, but as the conservator of ancient truth and ceremonial propriety. He dealt with neither theology nor metaphysics, but with moral and political conduct.</p>

<p>The Lun Yu, Analects or Sayings of Confucius, were probably compiled, says Legge, "by the disciples of the disciples of the sage, making free use of the written memorials concerning him which they had received, and the oral statements which they had heard, from their several masters. And we shall not be far wrong, if we determine its date as about the beginning of the third, or the end of the fourth century before Christ."</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>THE Master said: "In learning and straightway practising is there not pleasure also ? When friends gather round from afar do we not rejoice? Whom lack of fame cannot vex is not he a gentleman?"</p>

<p>[2] Yu-tzu1 said: "A dutiful son and brother is seldom fond of thwarting those over him: a man unwilling to thwart those over him is never given to crime. A gentleman nurses the roots: when the root has taken, the truth will grow; and what are the roots of love, but the duty of son and of brother?"</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "Honeyed words and flattering looks seldom speak of love."</p>

<p>[4] Tseng-tzu1 said: "Thrice daily I ask myself: 'Have I been unfaithful in dealing for others? Have I been untrue to friends? Do I practise what I preach?'"</p>

<p>[5] The Master said: "To guide a land of a thousand chariots, honour business, be true and sparing, love the people, and time thy claims upon them."</p>

<p>[6] The Master said: "The young should be dutiful at home, modest abroad, heedful and true, full of goodwill for the many, close friends with love; and should they have strength to spare, let them spend it upon the arts."</p>

<p>[7] Tzu-hsia1 said: "If a man honour worth and forsake lust, serve father and mother with all his strength, be ready to give his life for the king, and keep faith with his friends; though men may call him rude, I call him learned."</p>

<p>[8] The Master said: "Of a gentleman who is frivolous none stand in awe, nor can his learning be sound. Make faithfulness and truth</p>

<p>1 Disciples.</p>

<p>6 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>thy masters: have no friends unlike thyself: be not ashamed to mend thy faults."</p>

<p>[9] Tseng-tzu1 said: "Respect death and recall forefathers, the good in men will again grow sturdy."</p>

<p>[10] Tzu-ch'in1 said to Tzu-kung1: "The Master, on coming to a country, learns all about the government: does he ask, or is it told him?"</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "The Master learns it by his warmth and honesty, by politeness, modesty, and yielding. The way that the Master asks is unlike other men's asking."</p>

<p>[11] The Master said: "As long as his father lives a son should study his wishes; after he is dead, he should study his life. If for three years he do not forsake his father's ways, he may be called dutiful."</p>

<p>[12] Yu-tzu1 said: "In daily courtesy ease is of price. This was the beauty of the old kings' ways; this they followed in small and great. But knowing this, it is not right to give way to ease, unchecked by courtesy. This also is wrong."</p>

<p>[13] Yu-tzu said: "If promises hug the right, word can be kept: if attentions are bounded by courtesy, shame will be banished: heroes may be worshipped, if we choose them aright."</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "A gentleman who is not a greedy eater, nor a lover of ease at home, who is earnest in deed and careful of speech, who seeks the righteous and profits by them, may be called fond of learning."</p>

<p>[15] Tzu-kung said: "Poor, but no flatterer; rich, but not proud. How were that?"</p>

<p>"Good," said the Master; "but better still were poor, yet merry; rich, yet courteous."</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "Where the poem says:</p>

<p>'If ye cut, if ye file, If ye polish and grind';</p>

<p>is that what is meant?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Now I can talk of poetry to thee, Tz'u. Given a clue, thou canst find the way."</p>

<p>1 Disciples.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 7</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "Not to be known should not grieve you: grieve that ye know not men."</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>[i] The Master said: "In governing, cleave to good; as the north star holds his place, and the multitude of stars revolve upon him."</p>

<p>[2] The Master said: "To sum up the three hundred songs in a word, they are free from evil thought."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "Guide the people by law, subdue them by punishment; they may shun crime, but will be void of shame. Guide them by example, subdue them by courtesy; they will learn shame, and come to be good."</p>

<p>[4] The Master said: "At fifteen, I was bent on study; at thirty, I could stand; at forty, doubts ceased; at fifty, I understood the laws of Heaven; at sixty, my ears obeyed me; at seventy, I could do as my heart lusted, and never swerve from right."</p>

<p>[5] Meng Yi asked the duty of a son.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Obedience."</p>

<p>As Fan Ch'ih1 was driving him, the Master said: "Mengsun2 asked me the duty of a son; I answered 'Obedience.' " "What did ye mean?" said Fan Ch'ih.</p>

<p>"To serve our parents with courtesy whilst they live," said the Master; "to bury them with all courtesy when they die; and to worship them with all courtesy."</p>

<p>[6] Meng Wu asked the duty of a son.</p>

<p>The Master said: "What weighs on your father and mother is concern for your health." [7] Tzu-yu3 asked the duty of a son.</p>

<p>The Master said: "To-day a man is called dutiful if he keep his father and mother. But we keep both our dogs and horses, and unless we honour parents, is it not all one?"</p>

<p>[8] Tzu-hsia asked the duty of a son.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Our manner is the hard part. For the young to be a stay in toil, and leave the wine and cakes to their elders, is this to fulfil their duty?"</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[9] The Master said: "If I talk all day to Hui,4 like a dullard, he never stops me. But when he is gone, if I pry into his life, I find he can do what I say. No, Hui is no dullard."</p>

<p>[10] The Master said: "Look at a man's acts; watch his motives; find out what pleases him: can the man evade you? Can the man evade you?"</p>

<p>[11] The Master said: "Who keeps the old akindle and adds new knowledge is fitted to be a teacher."</p>

<p>[ 12] The Master said: "A gentleman is not a vessel."</p>

<p>[13] Tzu-kung asked, What is a gentleman?</p>

<p>The Master said: "He puts words into deed first, and sorts what he says to the deed."</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "A gentleman is broad and fair: the vulgar are biassed and petty."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "Study without thought is vain: thought without study is dangerous."</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "Work on strange doctrines does harm."</p>

<p>[17] The Master said: "Yu,5 shall I teach thee what is understanding? To know what we know, and know what we do not know, that is understanding."</p>

<p>[18] Tzu-chang6 studied with an eye to pay.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Listen much, keep silent when in doubt, and always take heed of the tongue; thou wilt make few mistakes. See much, beware of pitfalls, and always give heed to thy walk; thou wilt have little to rue. If thy words are seldom wrong, thy deeds leave little to rue, pay will follow."</p>

<p>[19] Duke Ai7 asked: "What should be done to make the people loyal?"</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "Exalt the straight, set aside the crooked, the people will be loyal. Exalt the crooked, set aside the straight, the people will be disloyal."</p>

<p>[20] Chi K'ang8 asked how to make the people lowly, faithful, and willing.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Behave with dignity, they will be lowly: be</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 9</p>

<p>pious and merciful, they will be faithful: exalt the good, teach the unskilful, they will grow willing."</p>

<p>[21] One said to Confucius: "Why are ye not in power, Sir?"</p>

<p>The Master answered: "What does the book say of a good son ? 'An always dutiful son, who is a friend to his brothers, showeth the way to rule.' This also is to rule. What need to be in power?"</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "Without truth I know not how man can live. A cart without a crosspole, a carriage without harness, how could they be moved?"</p>

<p>[23] Tzu-chang asked whether we can know what is to be ten generations hence.</p>

<p>The Master said: "The Yin9 inherited the manners of the Hsia;9 the harm and the good that they wrought them is known. The Chou9 inherited the manners of the Yin; the harm and the good that they wrought them is known. And we may know what is to be, even an hundred generations hence, when others follow Chou."</p>

<p>[24] The Master said: "To worship the ghosts of strangers is fawning. To see the right and not do it is want of courage."</p>

<p>Ill</p>

<p>[1] Of the Chi having eight rows of dancers1 in his hall, Confucius said: "If this is to be borne, what is not to be borne?"</p>

<p>[2] At the end of worship, the Three Clans made use of the Yung hymn.1</p>

<p>The Master said:</p>

<p>" 'The dukes and princes assist, Solemn is the Son of Heaven;'</p>

<p>what sense has this in the hall of the Three Clans?"</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "A man without love, what is courtesy to him? A man without love, what is music to him?"</p>

<p>[4] Lin Fang asked, What is the life of ceremony?</p>

<p>The Master said: "A great question! At hightides, waste is worse than thrift: at burials, grief outweighs nicety."</p>

<p>9 The three dynasties that had ruled China up till the time of Confucius. 1 An imperial prerogative.</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[5] The Master said: "The wild tribes have kings; whilst the realm of Hsia2 is without!"</p>

<p>[6] The Chi worshipped on Mount T'ai.3</p>

<p>The Master said to Jan Yu4: "Canst thou not stop this?"</p>

<p>He answered: "I cannot."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Master; "dost thou set Mount T'ai below Lin Fang?"</p>

<p>[7] The Master said: "A gentleman has no rivalriesexcept perhaps in archery; and then, as bowing he joins the winners, or steps down to see the loser drink, throughout the struggle he is still the gentleman."</p>

<p>[8] Tzu-hsia asked: "What is the meaning of:</p>

<p>'Her cunning smiles, Her dimples light, Her lovely eyes, So clear and bright, The ground, not yet With colours dight'?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Colouring follows groundwork."</p>

<p>"Then does courtesy follow after?" said Tzu-hsia.</p>

<p>"Shang,"5 said the Master, "thou hast hit my meaning! Now I can talk of poetry to thee."</p>

<p>[9] The Master said: "I can speak of the manners of Hsia; but for Chi witnesses fail. I can speak of the manners of Yin; but for Sung witnesses fail. This is due to their dearth of books and great men. Were there enough of these, they would witness for me."</p>

<p>[10] The Master said: "After the drink offering at the Great Sacrifice, I have no wish to see more."</p>

<p>[11] One asked about the words of the Great Sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Master said: "I do not understand them. Could one understand them, he would overlook the world as I this"and he pointed to his palm.</p>

<p>[12] Worship as though those ye worship stood before you; worship the spirits, as though they stood before you. The Master said: "If I take no part in the sacrifice, it is none to me."</p>

<p>2 China. 3 A prerogative of the Duke of Lu. 4 A disciple, in the service of the Chi. 5 Tzu-hsia.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS II</p>

<p>[13] Wang-sun Chia6 said: "What is the meaning of 'it is better to court the Kitchen God than the God of the Home'?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Master. "A sin against Heaven is past praying for."</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "Two lines of kings have passed beneath the ken of Chou. How rich in art is Chou! It is Chou I follow."</p>

<p>[15] On entering the Great Temple, the Master asked how each thing was done.</p>

<p>One said: "Who says that the man of Tsou's son has a knowledge of ceremony? On entering the Great Temple, he asked how each thing was done!"</p>

<p>On hearing this, the Master said: "Such is the ceremony."</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "To pierce through the target does not score in archery; because men differ in strength. This was the old rule."</p>

<p>[ 17] Tzu-kung wished to do away with the sheep offering at the new moon.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Thou lovest the sheep, Tz'u: I love the rite." [18] The Master said: "Treat the king with all courtesy, men call it fawning."</p>

<p>[19] Duke Ting asked how a king should behave to his ministers; how ministers should serve their king ?</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "A king should behave with courtesy to his ministers; ministers should serve their king faithfully."</p>

<p>[20] The Master said: "The poem 'The Osprey' is glad, but not wanton; it is sad, but not morbid."</p>

<p>[21] Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo7 about the shrines of the guardian spirits.</p>

<p>Tsai Wo answered: "The Hsia Emperors grew firs round them; the men of Yin grew cypress; the men of Chou grew chestnut, meaning 'jest not over holy matters.' "8</p>

<p>6 Wang-sun Chia was minister of Wei, and more influential than his master. The Kitchen God is less honourable than the God of the Home (the Roman lares), but since he sees all that goes on in the house, and ascends to Heaven at the end of the year to report what has happened, it is well to be on good terms with him.</p>

<p>7 A disciple of Confucius.</p>

<p>8 Literally "to cause the people to be in awe." The commentators are more than usually learned over the Master's anger. I attribute it to the foolishness of the pun, and translate accordingly.</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>On hearing this, the Master said: "I do not speak of what is ended, chide what is settled, or find fault with what is past."</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "How shallow was Kuan Chung!"9</p>

<p>"But," said one, "was not Kuan Chung thrifty?"</p>

<p>"Kuan owned San Kuei, and in his household none doubled offices," said the Master; "was that thrift?"</p>

<p>"At least Kuan Chung was versed in courtesy."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Kings screen their gates with trees; Kuan, too, had trees to screen his gate. When two kings make merry together, they have a stand for the turned-down cups; Kuan had a turned-down cup-stand too! If Kuan were versed in courtesy, who is not versed in courtesy?"</p>

<p>[23] The Master said to the chief musician of Lu: "How to play music may be known. At first each part in unison; then, a swell of harmony, each part distinct, rolling on to the finish."</p>

<p>[24] The warden of Yi asked to see Confucius, saying: "No gentleman has ever come here, whom I have failed to see."</p>

<p>The followers presented him.</p>

<p>On leaving he said: "My lads, why lament your fall ? The world has long been astray. Heaven will make of the Master a warning bell."</p>

<p>[25] The Master said: "All beautiful and noble is the music of Shao! The music of Wu is as beautiful, but less noble."</p>

<p>[26] The Master said: "Rank without bounty; ritual without reverence; mourning without grief, why should I cast them a glance?"</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>[1] The Master said: "Love makes a spot beautiful: who chooses not to dwell in love, has he got wisdom?"</p>

<p>[2] The Master said: "Loveless men cannot bear need long, they cannot bear fortune long. Loving hearts find peace in love; clever heads find profit in it."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "Love can alone love others, or hate others."</p>

<p>9 Kuan Chung (+b.c. 645), a famous man in his day, was chief minister to the Duke of Ch'i, whom he raised to such wealth and power, that he became the leading prince of the empire. His chief merit lay in crushing the barbarous frontier tribes. The rest of his work, being founded in the sand, died with Mm.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 13</p>

<p>[4] The Master said: "A heart set on love will do no wrong."</p>

<p>[5] The Master said: "Wealth and honours are what men desire; but abide not in them by help of wrong. Lowliness and want are hated of men; but forsake them not by help of wrong.</p>

<p>"Shorn of love, is a gentleman worthy the name? Not for one moment may a gentleman sin against love; not in flurry and haste, nor yet in utter overthrow."</p>

<p>[6] The Master said: "A friend to love, a foe to evil, I have yet to meet. A friend to love will set nothing higher. In love's service, a foe to evil will let no evil touch him. Were a man to give himself to love, but for one day, I have seen no one whose strength would fail him. Such men there may be, but I have not seen one."</p>

<p>[7] The Master said: "A man and his faults are of a piece. By watching his faults we learn whether love be his."</p>

<p>[8] The Master said: "To learn the truth at daybreak and die at eve were enough."</p>

<p>[9] The Master said: "A scholar in search of truth who is ashamed of poor clothes and poor food it is idle talking to."</p>

<p>[10] The Master said: "A gentleman has no likes and no dislikes below heaven. He follows right."</p>

<p>[11] The Master said: "Gentlemen cherish worth; the vulgar cherish dirt. Gentlemen trust in justice; the vulgar trust in favour."</p>

<p>[12] The Master said: "The chase of gain is rich in hate."</p>

<p>[13] The Master said: "What is it to sway a kingdom by courteous yielding ? Who cannot by courteous yielding sway a kingdom, what can he know of courtesy?"</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "Be not concerned at want of place; be concerned that thou stand thyself. Sorrow not at being unknown, but seek to be worthy of note."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "One thread, Shen,1 runs through all my teaching."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tseng-tzu.</p>

<p>After the Master had left, the disciples asked what was meant. Tseng-tzu said: "The Master's teaching all hangs on faithfulness and fellow-feeling."</p>

<p>'The disciple Tseng-tzu.</p>

<p>14 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "A gentleman considers what is right; the vulgar consider what will pay."</p>

<p>[17] The Master said: "At sight of worth, think to grow like it. When evil meets thee, search thine own heart."</p>

<p>[18] The Master said: "A father or mother may be gently chidden. If they will not bend, be the more lowly, but persevere; nor murmur if trouble follow."</p>

<p>[19] The Master said: "Whilst thy father and mother live, do not wander afar. If thou must travel, hold a set course."</p>

<p>[20] The Master said: "If for three years a son do not forsake his father's ways, he may be called dutiful."</p>

<p>[21] The Master said: "A father's and a mother's age must be borne in mind; with joy on the one hand, fear on the other."</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "Men of old were loth to speak; lest a word that they could not make good should shame them."</p>

<p>[23] The Master said: "Who contains himself goes seldom wrong."</p>

<p>[24] The Master said: "A gentleman wishes to be slow to speak and quick to act."</p>

<p>[25] The Master said: "Good is no hermit. It has ever neighbours."</p>

<p>[26] Tzu-yu said: "Preaching to princes brings disgrace, nagging at friends estrangement."</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>[1] Of Kung-yeh Ch'ang the Master said: "A girl might marry him. In him was no crime, though he has been in bonds." He gave him his daughter to wife.</p>

<p>Of Nan Jung the Master said: "When right prevails, he will not be neglected: when wrong prevails, he will escape law and punishment."</p>

<p>He gave him his brother's daughter to wife.</p>

<p>[2] Of Tzu-chien1 the Master said: "What a gentleman he is! But could he have grown to be a man like this were there no gentlemen in Lu?"</p>

<p>[3] Tzu-kung asked: "And what of me?"</p>

<p>"Thou art a vessel," said the Master.</p>

<p>"What kind of vessel?"</p>

<p>1A disciple, born in Lu.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 15</p>

<p>"A rich temple vessel."</p>

<p>[4] "Yung,"2 said one, "has love, but he has not a glib tongue."</p>

<p>The Master said: "What is the good of a glib tongue? Fighting men with tongue-craft breeds much bitterness. Whether love be his I do not know, but what is the good of a glib tongue?"</p>

<p>[5] The Master moved Ch'i-tiao K'ai3 to take office.</p>

<p>He answered: "For this I lack confidence."</p>

<p>The Master was pleased.</p>

<p>[6] The Master said: "Truth makes no way. Let me go afloat and scour the sea! and Yu4 shall follow me." When Tzu-lu heard this he was glad.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Yu is more venturesome than I, but he does not know how to take things."</p>

<p>[7] Meng Wu asked whether Tzu-lu had love? The Master said: "I do not know." He asked again.</p>

<p>The Master said: "A land of a thousand chariots might give Yu charge of its levies; but whether he have love, I do not know." "And how about Ch'iu?"5</p>

<p>"A town of a thousand households, a clan of an hundred chariots might make Ch'iu governor; but whether he have love, I do not know."</p>

<p>"And how about Ch'ih?"8</p>

<p>"Girt with his sash, erect in the court, Ch'ih might entertain the guests; but whether he have love, I do not know."</p>

<p>[8] The Master said to Tzu-kung: "Who is abler, thou or Hui?"7</p>

<p>He answered: "How dare I aspire to Hui? If he hear one thing, Hui understands ten; when I hear one thing, I understand two."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Thou art not his peer. I grant, thou art not his peer."</p>

<p>[9] Tsai Yii8 slept in the daytime.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Rotten wood cannot be carved, nor are dung walls plastered. Why chide with Yii ?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "In my first dealings with men, I hearkened to their words, and took their deeds on trust. Now, in dealing with</p>

<p>2 The disciple Chung-kung.    3 A disciple.    4 The disciple Tzu-lu.</p>

<p>s The disciple Jan Yu.    6 The disciple Kung-hsi Hua.    7 The disciple Yen Yuan.</p>

<p>'The disciple Tsai Wo.</p>

<p>16 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>men, I hearken to their words, and watch their deeds. I righted this on Yu."</p>

<p>[10] The Master said: "I have met no firm man." One answered. "Shen Ch'ang."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Ch'ang is passionate: how can he be firm?"</p>

<p>[n] Tzu-kung said: "What I do not wish to have done unto me, I likewise wish not to do linto others."</p>

<p>The Master said: "That is still beyond thee, Tz'u."</p>

<p>[12] Tzu-kung said: "We may listen to the Master's culture; but on life and the ways of Heaven his words are denied us."</p>

<p>[13] Until Tzu-lu could carry out what he heard, he only dreaded to hear more.</p>

<p>[14] Tzu-kung asked: "Why was K'ung-wen styled cultured?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "He was quick and fond of learning, not ashamed to ask those beneath him. That is why he was called cultured."</p>

<p>[15] Of Tzu-ch'an the Master said: "In four ways he was a gentleman. His own life was modest; he honoured the man whom he served; he was kind in rearing the people; he was just in his calls upon them."</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "Yen P'ing was versed in friendship. Familiarity bred courtesy."</p>

<p>[17] The Master said: "Tsang Wen lodged his tortoise with hills on the pillars, reeds on the uprights. Was this his good sense?"</p>

<p>[18] Tzu-chang said: "Tzu-wen was thrice made minister without show of gladness, and thrice left office with unmoved face. He was careful to unfold his rule to the new minister. What do ye think of him?"</p>

<p>"He was faithful," said the Master.</p>

<p>"But had he love?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said the Master: "how should this amount to love?"</p>

<p>"When Ts'ui slew the King of Ch'i, Ch'en Wen forsook ten teams of horses, and left the land. On coming to another kingdom, he said, 'Like my lord Ts'ui,' and left it. On coming to a second kingdom, he said, 'Like my lord Ts'ui,' and left it. What do ye think of him?"</p>

<p>"He was pure," said the Master.</p>

<p>"But had he love?"</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 17</p>

<p>"I do not know," said the Master: "how should this amount to love?"</p>

<p>[19] Chi Wen thought thrice before acting.</p>

<p>On hearing this, the Master said: "Twice, that is enough."</p>

<p>[20] The Master said: "Whilst peace reigned in the land Ning Wu9 showed understanding: when troubles came he turned simpleton. His understanding is within our reach; such simplicity is beyond our reach."</p>

<p>[21] When he was in Ch'en the Master said: "Home, I must go home! My batch of boys, ambitious and hasty, their minds cultured, their schooling ended, know not what needs fashioning!"</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "As Po-yi10 and Shu-ch'i never recalled past wickedness the foes they made were few."</p>

<p>[23] The Master said: "Who would call Wei-sheng Kao straight? A man begged him for vinegar. He begged it from a neighbour and gave it."</p>

<p>[24] The Master said: "Honeyed words, flattering looks and overdone humility, Tso Ch'in-ming thought shameful, and so do I. To hide ill-will and ape friendship, Tso Ch'in-ming thought shameful, and so do I."</p>

<p>[25] As Yen Yuan and Chi-lu11 were sitting with him, the Master said: "Why not each of you tell me his wishes?"</p>

<p>Tzu-lu said: "Carriages and horses I would have, and robes of fine fur to share with my friends, and would wear them out all free from care."</p>

<p>9 Ning Wu was minister to the Duke of Wei, in the middle of the seventh century b.c. The duke was driven from his throne, and deserted by the wise and prudent; but Ning Wu, in his simplicity, followed his master everywhere, and finally effected his restoration.</p>

<p>10 Po-yi and Shu-ch'i were sons of the King of Ku-chu. Their father left the throne to the younger of the two; but he would not supplant the elder, nor would the elder act against his father's wishes. So they both retired into obscurity. When King Wu overthrew the tyrant Chou (b.c. 1122), rather than live under a new dynasty, they starved to death. Of Po-yi, Mencius tells us (V. B. 1): "His eyes could not look on evil, nor his ears listen to evil. He would serve none but his own king, lead none but his own people. He took office when order reigned, and left it when times grew turbulent. He could not bear to live under lawless rulers, or amongst a lawless people. To stand by the side of a countryman he thought like sitting, in court dress, in the midst of dust and ashes. Through Chou's day he dwelt on the shores of the North Sea, waiting till the world grew clean. So when men hear tell of Po-yi, fools grow honest, weak wills grow strong."</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>[1] The Master said: "Yung1 might fill the seat of a prince." "And might Tzu-sang Po-tzu?" asked Chung-kung. "Yes," said the Master: "but he is lax."</p>

<p>"To be lax in his claims on the people might be right," said Chung-kung, "were he stern to self; but to be lax to self and lax to others must surely be over-lax."</p>

<p>The Master said: "What Yung says is true."</p>

<p>[2] Duke Ai asked which disciples were fond of learning.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Give her half a quarter." Jan gave her twenty-five quarters.</p>

<p>The Master said: "On his way to Ch'i, Ch'ih4 was drawn by sleek horses, clad in fine furs. A gentleman, I have heard, helps the needy: he does not swell riches."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Yu8 has character; what would governing be to him?"</p>

<p>"Tz'u is intelligent; what would governing be to him?"</p>

<p>"And Ch'iu,10 is he fit for power?"</p>

<p>"Ch'iu has ability; what would governing be to him?"</p>

<p>[7] The Chi sent to make Min Tzu-ch'ien11 governor of Pi.</p>

<p>Min Tzu-ch'ien said: "Make some good excuse for me. If he send again, I must be across the Wen."</p>

<p>[8] When Po-niu" was ill the Master went to ask after him. Grasping his hand through the window, he said: "He is dying. It is our lot. But why this man of such an illness ? why this man of such an illness?"</p>

<p>He asked, What is love ?</p>

<p>The Master said: "To rank the effort above the prize may be called love."</p>

<p>The Master said: "What has this to do with love? Would it not be holiness? Both Yao and Shun18 still yearned for this. In seeking a foothold for self, love finds a foothold for others; seeking light for itself, it enlightens others also. To learn from the near at hand may be called the key to love."</p>

<p>VII</p>

<p>[1] The Master said: "A teller and not a maker, one who trusts and loves the past; I may be likened to our old P'eng." 1</p>

<p>2 Died b.c. 1105. He was the younger brother of King Wu, the founder of the Chou dynasty, as great in peace as the king in war. He was so anxious to carry out olden principles, "that when aught he saw did not tally with them, he would look up in thought, till day gave way to night; and if by good luck he found the answer, would sit on waiting for dawn" (Mencius, IV. B. 20).</p>

<p>[10] The Master said to Yen Yuan: "I and thou alone can both fill a post when given one and live unseen when passed by."</p>

<p>Tzu-lu said: "Had ye to command three armies, Sir, who should go with you?"</p>

<p>"No man," said the Master, "ready to fly unarmed at a tiger, or plunge into a river and die without a pang should be with me; but one, rather, who is wary before a move and gains his end by well-laid plans."</p>

<p>[11] The Master said: "Were shouldering a whip a sure road to riches, I would turn carter: but since there is no sure road, I tread the path I love."</p>

<p>[12] The Master gave heed to devotions, war, and sickness.</p>

<p>[13] When the Master was in Ch'i for three months after hearing the Shao played he knew not the taste of meat.</p>

<p>"I did not suppose," he said, "that music could touch such heights."</p>

<p>[14] Jan Yu said: "Is the Master for the King of Wei?"3</p>

<p>"I will ask him," said Tzu-kung.</p>

<p>He went in, and said: "What kind of men were Po-yi4 and Shu-ch'i?" "Worthy men of yore," said the Master. "Did they rue the past?"</p>

<p>"They sought love and found it; what had they to rue?"</p>

<p>Tzu-kung went out, and said: "The Master is not on his side."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "Living on coarse rice and water, with bent arm for pillow, mirth may be ours; but ill-gotten wealth and honours are to me a wandering cloud."</p>

<p>5 An abstruse, ancient classic, usually called the Book of Changes.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 23</p>

<p>Tzu-lu did not answer.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Why couldst thou not say: 'He is a man so eager that he forgets to eat, whose cares are lost in triumph, unmindful of approaching age'?"</p>

<p>[19] The Master said: "I was not born to understanding. I loved the past, and questioned it earnestly."</p>

<p>[20] The Master never spake of ghosts or strength, crime or spirits.</p>

<p>[21] The Master said: "Walking three together I am sure of teachers. I pick out the good and follow it; I see the bad and shun it."</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "Heaven planted worth in me; what harm can come of Huan T'ui?"6</p>

<p>[23] The Master said: "My boys, do ye think that I hide things from you ? I hide nothing. One who keeps from his boys nought that he does, such is Ch'iu."7</p>

<p>[24] The four things the Master taught were culture, conduct, faithfulness, and truth.</p>

<p>[25] The Master said: "A holy man I shall not live to see; enough could I find a gentleman! A good man I shall not live to see; enough could I find a steadfast one! But when nothing poses as something, cloud as substance, want as riches, steadfastness must be rare."</p>

<p>[26] The Master angled, but did not fish with a net; he shot, but not at birds sitting.</p>

<p>[27] The Master said: "There may be men who act without understanding why. I do not. To listen much, pick out the good and follow it; to see much and ponder it: this comes next to understanding."</p>

<p>[28] It was ill talking to the Hu villagers. A lad having been admitted, the disciples wondered.</p>

<p>The Master said: "I allow his coming, not what is to come. Why be so harsh ? If a man cleanse himself to gain admission, I admit his cleanness, but go not bail for his past."</p>

<p>[29] The Master said: "Is love so far a thing? I yearn for love, and lo! love is come."</p>

<p>[30] A judge of Ch'en asked whether Duke of Chao8 knew courtesy.</p>

<p>8In b.c. 495, during Confucius' wanderings, Huan T'ui was an officer of Sung. He sent a band of men to kill Confucius; but why he did so is not clear.</p>

<p>'Confucius. 8Duke Chao of Lu (+b.c. 510) was the duke who first employed Confucius. It is contrary to Chinese custom for a man to marry a girl of the same surname as himself.</p>

<p>24 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "He knew courtesy."</p>

<p>After Confucius had left, the judge beckoned Wu-ma Ch'i9 to his side, and said: "I had heard that gentlemen are of no party, but are they too for party ? The prince married a Wu, of the same name as himself, and called her Miss Tzu of Wu. If the prince knew courtesy, who does not know courtesy?"</p>

<p>When Wu-ma Ch'i told this to the Master, he said: "How lucky I am! If I make a slip, men are sure to know it!"</p>

<p>[31] When any one sang to the Master, and sang well, he would make him repeat it and join in.</p>

<p>[32] The Master said: "I have no more culture than others: to live as a gentleman is not yet mine."</p>

<p>[33] The Master said: "How dare I lay claim to holiness or love? A man of endless craving I might be called, an unflagging teacher; but nothing more."</p>

<p>"That is just what we disciples cannot learn," said Kung-hsi Hua.</p>

<p>[34] The Master being very ill, Tzu-lu asked leave to pray. The Master said: "Is it the custom?"</p>

<p>"It is," answered Tzu-lu. "The Memorials say, 'Pray to the spirits in heaven above and on earth below.' "</p>

<p>The Master said: "Long lasting has my prayer been."</p>

<p>[35] The Master said: "Waste begets self-will; thrift begets meanness : but better be mean than self-willed."</p>

<p>[36] The Master said: "A gentleman is calm and spacious: the vulgar are always fretting."</p>

<p>[37] The Master was friendly, yet dignified; he inspired awe, but not fear; he was respectful, yet easy.</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>[1] The Master said: "T'ai-po1 might indeed be called a man of highest worth. Thrice he gave up the throne. Men were at a loss how to praise him."</p>

<p>9 A disciple of Confucius.</p>

<p>1 T'ai-po was the eldest son of the King of Chou. The father wished his third son to succeed him, in order that the throne might pass through him to his famous son, afterwards known as King Wen. To facilitate this plan T'ai-po and his second brother went into voluntary exile.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 25</p>

<p>[2] The Master said: "Without a sense of courtesy, attentions grow into fussiness, heed turns to fearfulness, courage becomes un-ruliness, uprightness turns to harshness. When the gentry are true to kinsmen, love will thrive among the people. If they do not forsake old friends, the people will not be selfish."</p>

<p>[3] When Tseng-tzu lay sick he summoned his disciples and said: "Uncover my feet, uncover my arms. The poem says:</p>

<p>'As though a deep gulf</p>

<p>Were yawning below, As crossing thin ice,</p>

<p>Take heed how ye go.'</p>

<p>Till this day, and beyond, I have walked unscathed, my boys."2</p>

<p>[4] When Tseng-tzu lay sick Meng Ching3 came to ask after him.</p>

<p>Tseng-tzu said: "When a bird is to die, his note is sad; when a man is to die, his words are true. There are three duties that a gentleman prizes: to banish from his bearing violence and levity; to sort his face to the truth; to purge his speech of the low and unfair. As for temple matters there are officers to mind them."</p>

<p>[5] Tseng-tzu said: "Out of knowledge to learn from ignorance, out of wealth to learn from penury; having to seem wanting, real to seem shadow; when gainsaid never answering back: I had once a friend who would act thus." 4</p>

<p>[6] Tseng-tzu said: "A man to whom an orphan stripling or the fate of an hundred townships may be entrusted, and whom no crisis can corrupt, is he not a gentleman, a gentleman indeed?"</p>

<p>[7] Tseng-tzu said: "The scholar had need be strong and bold; for his burden is heavy, the road is far. His burden is love, is it not a heavy one? Death is the goal, is that not far?"</p>

<p>[8] The Master said: "Poetry rouses, courtesy upholds us, music is our crown."</p>

<p>[9] The Master said: "The people may be made to follow: they cannot be made to understand."</p>

<p>[10] The Master said: "Love of daring, inflamed by poverty, leads to crime: a man without love, if deeply ill-treated, will turn to crime."</p>

<p>2 The Chinese say: "The body is born whole by the mother; it is for the son to return it again whole."    3 Head of the Meng clan, minister of Lu. * This is believed to refer to Yen Yuan.</p>

<p>26 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[u] The Master said: "All the glorious gifts of the Duke of Chou,5 if coupled with pride and meanness, would not be worth one glance."</p>

<p>[12] The Master said: "A man to whom three years of study have borne no fruit would be hard to find."</p>

<p>[13] The Master said: "A man who loves learning with simple faith, who to mend his life is content to die, will not enter a tottering kingdom, nor stay in a land distraught. When right prevails below heaven, he is seen; when wrong prevails, he is unseen. When right prevails, he would blush to be poor and lowly; when wrong prevails, wealth and honours would shame him."</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "When not in office, discuss not policy."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "In the first days of the music master Chih how grand was the ending of the Kuan-chii! How it filled the ear!"</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "Of such as are eager, but not straight; shallow, but not simple; dull, but not truthful, I will know nothing."</p>

<p>[17] The Master said: "Study as though the time were short, as one who fears to lose."</p>

<p>[18] The Master said: "It was sublime how Shun and Yii swayed the world and made light of it!"</p>

<p>[19] The Master said: "How great was Yao in kingship! Sublime! Heaven alone is great; Yao alone was patterned on it! Boundless! Men's words failed them. Sublime the work he did, dazzling the wealth of his culture!"</p>

<p>[20] Shun had five ministers, and order reigned below heaven.</p>

<p>King Wu said: "Ten in number are my able ministers."</p>

<p>Confucius said: " 'The dearth of talent,' is not that the truth ? The days when Yii6 succeeded T'ang7 were rich in talent; yet there were but nine men in all, and one of these was a woman. The utmost worth was the worth of Chou!8 Lord of two-thirds of the earth, he submitted all to Yin."</p>

<p>[21] The Master said: "I find no flaw in Yii. Frugal in eating and drinking, he was lavish to the ghosts of the dead: ill-clad, he was gorgeous in cap and gown: his home a hovel, he poured out his strength upon dikes and ditches. No kind of flaw can I find in Yii." 5 See note to vii. 5.    6 Shun.    7 Yao.    8 King Wen, Duke of Chou.</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>[1] The Master seldom spake of gain, doom, or love.</p>

<p>[2] A man from the Ta-hsiang village said: "The great Confucius, with his vast learning, has made no name in anything."</p>

<p>When the Master heard it, he said to his disciples: "What shall I take up? Shall I take up charioteering? Shall I take up bowman-ship ? I must take up charioteering."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "A linen cap is correct: to-day silk is worn. It is cheap, and I follow the many. To bow below is correct: to-day it is done above. This is overweening, and, despite the many, I bow below."</p>

<p>[4] From four things the Master was quite free. He had no by-views; he knew not "must," or "shall," or "I."</p>

<p>[5] When the Master was affrighted in K'uang,1 he said: "Since the death of King Wen, is not this the home of culture ? Had Heaven condemned culture, later mortals had missed their share in it. If Heaven uphold culture, what can the men of K'uang do to me?"</p>

<p>[6] A high minister said to Tzu-kung: "The Master must be a holy man, he can do so many things!"</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "Heaven has indeed well-nigh endowed him with holiness, and he is many-sided too."</p>

<p>When the Master heard it, he said: "Does the minister know me ? Being lowly born, I learned many an humble trade in my youth. But has a gentleman skill in many things ? No, in few things."</p>

<p>Lao said that the Master would say: "Having no post, I learned a craft."</p>

<p>[7] The Master said: "Have I in truth understanding? I have no understanding. But if a yokel ask me aught in an empty way, I tap it on this side and that, and sift it to the bottom."</p>

<p>[8] The Master said: "The phoenix comes not, nor does the river give forth a sign. All is over with me!"</p>

<p>[9] When the Master saw folk clad in mourning, or in robes of</p>

<p>1 During the Master's wanderings. K'uang is said to have been a small state near Lu, that had been oppressed by Yang Huo. Confucius resembled him, and the men of K'uang set upon him, mistaking him for their enemy. The commentators say that the Master was not affrighted, only "roused to a sense of danger." I cannot find that the text says so.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>state, or else a blind man, he made a point of risingeven for the youngor, if he were passing by, of quickening his step.</p>

<p>[10] Yen Yuan heaved a sigh and said: "As I gaze it grows higher, more remote as I dig! I sight it in front, next moment astern! The Master tempts men forward deftly bit by bit. He widened me with culture, he bound me with courtesy. Until my strength was spent I had no power to stop. The goal seemed at hand: I longed to reach it, but the way was closed."</p>

<p>[n] When the Master was very ill, Tzu-lu moved the disciples to act as ministers.</p>

<p>During a better spell the Master said: "Yu has long been feigning. This show of ministers, when I have no ministers, whom can it deceive? Will it deceive Heaven? Moreover, is it not better to die in your arms, my boys, than to die in the arms of ministers? And if I lack a grand burial, shall I die by the roadside?"</p>

<p>[12] Tzu-kung said: "Were a beauteous jadestone mine, ought I to hide it away in a case, or seek a good price and sell it ?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Sell it, sell it! I tarry for my price."</p>

<p>[13] The Master wished to make his home among the nine tribes.2</p>

<p>One said: "They are low, how could ye?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Where a gentleman has his home, can aught live that is low?"</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "After I came back from Wei to Lu the music was set straight and each song found its place."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "To serve men of high rank when abroad, and father and brothers when at home; to dread slackness in graveside duties, and be no thrall to wine: to which of these have I won?"</p>

<p>[16] As he stood by a stream, the Master said: "Hasting away like this, day and night without stop!"</p>

<p>[17] The Master said: "I have found none who love good as they love women."</p>

<p>[18] The Master said: "In making a mound, if I stop when one basketful more would end it, it is I that stop. In levelling ground, if I go on after throwing down one basketful, it is I that proceed."</p>

<p>[23] The Master said: "Who would not give ear to a downright word? But to mend is of price. Who would not be pleased by a guiding word? But to ponder the word is of price. With such as give ear, but will not mend; who are pleased, but will not ponder, I can do nothing."</p>

<p>30 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>The Master said: "Her thoughts were not with him, or how could he be far away?"</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>[i] Amongst his own country folk Confucius wore a homely look, like one who has no word to say.</p>

<p>In the ancestral temple and at court his speech was full, but cautious.</p>

<p>[2] At court, he talked frankly to men of low rank, winningly to men of high rank.</p>

<p>In the king's presence he looked intent and solemn.</p>

<p>[3] When the king bade him receive guests, his face seemed to change, his knees to bend. He bowed left and right to those beside him, straightened his robes in front and behind, and sped forward, his elbows spread like wings. When the guest had left, he always reported it, saying: "The guest has ceased to look back."</p>

<p>[4] Entering the palace gate he stooped, as though it were too low for him. He did not stand in the middle of the gate, nor step on the threshold.</p>

<p>Passing the throne, his face seemed to change, his knees to bend, he spake with bated breath.</p>

<p>Mounting the dais, he lifted his robes, bowed his back and masked his breathing, till it seemed to stop.</p>

<p>Coming down, his face relaxed below the first step, and bore a pleased look. From the foot of the steps he sped forward, his elbows spread like wings; and when again in his seat he looked intent as before.</p>

<p>[5] When bearing the sceptre, his back bent, as under too heavy a burden. He held his hands not higher than in bowing, nor lower than in giving a present. He wore an awed look and dragged his feet, as though they were fettered.</p>

<p>When presenting royal gifts his manner was formal; but he was cheerful at the private audience.</p>

<p>[6] This gentleman was never arrayed in maroon or scarlet; even at home he would not don red or purple.</p>

<p>In hot weather he wore unlined linen clothes, but always over other garments.</p>

<p>[8] He did not dislike his rice cleaned with care, nor his hash chopped small.</p>

<p>He did not eat sour or mouldy rice, putrid fish, or tainted meat. Aught discoloured, or high, badly cooked, or out of season, he would not eat. He would not eat what was badly cut, or a dish with the wrong sauce. A choice of meats could not tempt him to eat more than he had a relish for. To wine alone he set no limit, but he did not drink till he got fuddled.</p>

<p>He did not drink bought wine, or eat ready-dried market meat.</p>

<p>Ginger was never missing at table.</p>

<p>He did not eat much.</p>

<p>After sacrifice at the palace he would not keep the meat over night, at home not more than three days. If kept longer it was not eaten.</p>

<p>He did not talk at meals, nor speak when in bed.</p>

<p>Though there were but coarse rice and vegetable soup, he made his offering with all reverence.</p>

<p>[9] If his mat were not straight, he would not sit down.</p>

<p>[10] When drinking with the villagers, as those with staves left, he left too.</p>

<p>At the village exorcisms he donned court dress, and stood on the eastern steps.</p>

<p>[11] When sending inquiries to another land, he bowed twice and saw his messenger out.</p>

<p>On K'ang making him a gift of medicine, he accepted it with a bow, saying: "I do not know it: I dare not taste it."</p>

<p>When dining in attendance on the king, the king made the offering, Confucius ate of things first.</p>

<p>On the king coming to see him in sickness, he turned his face to the east and had his court dress spread across him, with the girdle over it.</p>

<p>When summoned by the king, he walked, without waiting for his carriage.</p>

<p>[14] On entering the Great Temple he asked how each thing was done.</p>

<p>[15] When a friend died who had no home to go to, he said: "It is for me to bury him."</p>

<p>[16] He did not sleep like a corpse. At home he unbent.</p>

<p>On meeting a mourner, and were he a friend, his face changed. Even in everyday clothes, when he met any one in full dress, or a blind man, his face grew staid.</p>

<p>Before choice meats he rose with changed look. At sharp thunder, or fierce wind, his look changed.</p>

<p>[17] In mounting his chariot he stood straight and grasped the cord. When in his chariot he did not look round, speak fast, or point.</p>

<p>[18] Seeing a man's face, she rose, flew round and settled.</p>

<p>He and Tzu-lu got on the scent thrice and then she rose.</p>

<p>XI</p>

<p>[1] The Master said: "Those who led the way in courtesy and music are deemed rude, and elegant the later school of courtesy and music. My wont is to follow the leaders."</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 33</p>

<p>[2] The Master said: "None of the men who were with me in Ch'en or Ts'ai come any more to my door! Of noble life were Yen Yuan, Min Tzu-ch'ien, Jan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; Tsai Wo and Tzu-kung were the talkers; statesmen Jan Yu and Chi-lu. Tzu-yu and Tzu-hsia were men of culture."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "I get no help from Hui.1 No word I say but delights him!"</p>

<p>[4] The Master said: "How good a son was Min Tzu-ch'ien! In all that parents and brethren said of him no hole was picked."</p>

<p>[6] Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved learning.</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "Yen Hui3 loved learning. By ill luck his life was cut short. Now there is no one."</p>

<p>[7] When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu* asked for the Master's chariot to furnish an outer coffin.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Whether gifted or not, each one speaks of his son. When Li5 died he had an inner but not an outer coffin. I would not walk on foot to furnish an outer coffin. Following in the wake of the ministry, it would ill become me to walk on foot."</p>

<p>[8] When Yen Yuan died the Master cried: "Woe is me! I am undone of Heaven! I am undone of Heaven!"</p>

<p>[9] When Yen Yuan died the Master gave way to grief.</p>

<p>Those with him said: "Sir, ye are giving way."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Am I giving way? If for this man I did not give way to grief, for whom should I give way?"</p>

<p>[10] When Yen Yuan died the disciples wished to bury him in state.</p>

<p>The Master said: "This must not be." The disciples buried him in state.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Hui treated me as a father: I have failed to treat him as a son. No, not I: it was your doing, my boys."</p>

<p>"A flaw can be ground From a sceptre white; A slip of the tongue No man can right." ' Yen Yuan.    1 The father of Yen Yuan.    5 Confucius' son.</p>

<p>34 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[n] Chi-lu6 asked what is due to the ghosts of the dead. The Master said: "We fail in our duty to the living; can we do our duty to the dead?" He ventured to ask about death.</p>

<p>"We know not life," said the Master, "how can we know death?"</p>

<p>[12] Seeing the disciple Min standing at his side in winning strength, Tzu-lu with war-like front, Jan Yu and Tzu-kung fresh and rank, the Master's heart was glad.</p>

<p>"A man like Yu,"7 he said, "dies before his day."</p>

<p>[13] The men of Lu were building the Long Treasury.</p>

<p>Min Tzu-ch'ien said: "Would not the old one do? Why must a new one be built?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "That man does not talk: when he speaks, he hits the mark."</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "What has the lute of Yu8 to do twanging at my door!"</p>

<p>But when the disciples began to look down on Tzu-lu, the Master said: "Yu has climbed to the hall, though he has not passed the closet door."</p>

<p>[15] Tzu-kung asked whether Shih9 or Shang10 were the better man.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Shih goes too far: Shang goes not far enough."</p>

<p>"Then Shih is the better man," said Tzu-kung.</p>

<p>"Too far," replied the Master, "is no better than not far enough."</p>

<p>[16] The Chi was richer than the Duke of Chou: Ch'iu11 added to his wealth by becoming his tax-gatherer.</p>

<p>The Master said: "He is no disciple of mine. Sound your drums to the attack, my boys!"</p>

<p>[17] Ch'ai12 is simple, Shen13 is dull, Shih14 is smooth, Yu15 is coarse.</p>

<p>6 Tzu-lu. 7 Tzu-lu. This prophecy came true. Tzu-lu and Tzu-kao were officers of Wei when troubles arose. Tzu-lu hastened to the help of his master. He met Tzu-kao withdrawing from the danger, and was advised to follow suit. But Tzu-lu refused to desert the man whose pay he drew. He plunged into the fight and was killed.    8 Tzu-lu.

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 35</p>

<p>[18] The Master said: "Hui16 is well-nigh faultless, and ofttimes empty. Tz'u17 will not bow to fate, and hoards up substance; but his views are often sound."</p>

<p>[19] Tzu-chang asked, What is the way of a good man?</p>

<p>The Master said: "He does not tread in footprints; neither can he gain the closet."</p>

<p>[20] The Master said: "Commend a man for plain speaking: he may prove a gentleman, or else but seeming honest."</p>

<p>[21] Tzu-lu asked: "Shall I do all I am taught?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Whilst thy father and elder brothers live, how canst thou do all thou art taught?"</p>

<p>Jan Yu asked: "Shall I do all I am taught?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Do all thou art taught."</p>

<p>Kung-hsi Hua said: "Yu18 asked, 'Shall I do all I am taught?' and ye spake, Sir, of father and elder brothers. Ch'iu19 asked, 'Shall I do all I am taught?' and ye answered, 'Do all thou art taught.' I am puzzled, and make bold to ask you, Sir."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Ch'iu is bashful, so I egged him on: Yu has the pluck of two, so I held him back."</p>

<p>[22] When fear beset the Master in K'uang, Yen Yuan fell behind.</p>

<p>The Master said: "I held thee as dead."</p>

<p>He answered: "Whilst my Master lives durst I brave death?"</p>

<p>[23] Chi Tzu-jan20 asked whether Chung Yu21 or Jan Ch'iu22 could be called statesmen.</p>

<p>The Master said: "I thought ye would ask me some riddle, Sir, and your text is Yu21 and Ch'iu.22 A minister who does his duty to the king, and withdraws rather than do wrong, is called a statesman. As for Yu and Ch'iu, I should call them tools."</p>

<p>"Who would do one's bidding then?"</p>

<p>"Neither would they do your bidding," said the Master, "if bidden slay king or father."</p>

<p>[24] Tzu-lu had Tzu-kao made governor of Pi. The Master said: "Thou art undoing a man's son."</p>

<p>36 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>Tzu-lu said: "What with the people and the guardian spirits must a man read books to come by knowledge?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "This is why I hate a glib tongue."</p>

<p>[25] The Minister said to Tzu-lu, Tseng Hsi,23 Jan Yu, and Kung-hsi Hua as they sat beside him: "I may be a day older than you, but forget that. Ye are wont to say, 'I am unknown.' Well, had ye a name, what would ye do ?"</p>

<p>Tzu-lu lightly answered: "Give me charge of a land of a thousand chariots, crushed between great neighbours, overrun by soldiery and searched by famine, in three years' time I could put courage into the people and high purpose."</p>

<p>The Master smiled.</p>

<p>"What wouldst thou do, Ch'iu?"24 he said.</p>

<p>He answered: "Had I charge of sixty or seventy square miles, or from fifty to sixty square miles, in three years' time I would give the people plenty. As for courtesy, music, and the like, they would wait the rise of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"And what wouldst thou do, Ch'ih?"25</p>

<p>He answered: "I speak of the things I fain would learn, not of what I can do. At service in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand Audience, clad in black robe and cap, I fain would fill a small part."</p>

<p>"And what wouldst thou do, Tien?"26</p>

<p>Tien ceased to play, pushed his still sounding lute aside, rose and answered: "My choice would be unlike those of the other three."</p>

<p>"What harm in that ?" said the Master. "Each but spake his mind."</p>

<p>"In the last days of spring, all clad for the season, with five or six grown men and six or seven lads, I would bathe in the Yi, be fanned by the breeze in the Rain God's glade, and wander home with song."</p>

<p>The Master sighed and said: "I hold with Tien."</p>

<p>Tseng Hsi stayed after the other three had left, and said: "What did ye think of what the others said, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Each but spake his mind," said the Master.</p>

<p>"Why did ye smile at Yu,27 Sir?"</p>

<p>"Lands are swayed by courtesy, but what he said was not modest. That was why I smiled."</p>

<p>23 A disciple: the father of Tseng-tzu.     24 Jan Yu.    25 Kung-hsi Hua. 26 Tseng Hsi.    27 Tzu-lu.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 37</p>

<p>"But did not Ch'iu, too, speak of a state?"</p>

<p>"Where could sixty or seventy square miles be found, or from fifty to sixty, that are not a state?"</p>

<p>"And did not Ch'ih, too, speak of a state?"</p>

<p>"Who but great vassals would there be in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand Audience? But if Ch'ih were to play a small part, who could fill a big one ?"</p>

<p>XII</p>

<p>[i] Yen Yuan asked, What is love?</p>

<p>The Master said: "Love is to conquer self and turn to courtesy. Could we conquer self and turn to courtesy for but one day, all mankind would turn to love. Does love flow from within, or does it flow from others?"</p>

<p>Yen Yuan said: "May I ask what are its signs?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "To be ever courteous of eye and ever courteous of ear; to be ever courteous in word and ever courteous in deed."</p>

<p>Yen Yuan said: "Dull as I am, I hope to live by these words." [2] Chung-kung asked, What is love?</p>

<p>The Master said: "Without the door to behave as though a great guest were come; to treat the people as though we tendered the high sacrifice; not to do unto others what we would not they should do unto us; to breed no wrongs in the state and breed no wrongs in the home."</p>

<p>Chung-kung said: "Dull as I am, I hope to live by these words." [3] Ssu-ma Niu1 asked, What is love? The Master said: "Love is slow to speak." "To be slow to speak! Can that be called love?" The Master said: "That which is hard to do, can it be lightly spoken?"</p>

<p>[4] Ssu-ma Niu asked, What is a gentleman? The Master said: "A gentleman knows neither sorrow nor fear." "No sorrow and no fear! Can that be called a gentleman?" The Master said: "He finds no sin in his heart, so why should he sorrow, what should he fear?"</p>

<p>1 A disciple.</p>

<p>3 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[5] Ssu-ma Niu cried sadly: "All men have brothers, I alone have none!"</p>

<p>Tzu-hsia said: "I have heard that life and death are allotted, that wealth and honours are in Heaven's hand. A gentleman is careful and does not trip; he is humble towards others and courteous. All within the four seas are brethren; how can a gentleman mourn his lack of them?"</p>

<p>[6] Tzu-chang asked, What is insight?</p>

<p>The Master said: "To be unmoved by lap and wash of slander, or by plaints that pierce to the quick, may be called insight. Yea, whom lap and wash of slander, or plaints that pierce to the quick cannot move may be called far-sighted."</p>

<p>[7] Tzu-kung asked, What is kingcraft?</p>

<p>The Master said: "Food enough, troops enough, and a trusting people."</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "Were there no help for it, which could best be spared of the three?' "Troops," said the Master.</p>

<p>"And were there no help for it, which could better be spared of</p>

<p>the other two?"</p>

<p>"Food," said the Master. "From of old all men die, but without trust a people cannot stand."</p>

<p>[8] Chi Tzu-ch'eng2 said: "A gentleman is all nature: what can art do for him?"</p>

<p>"Alas! my lord," said Tzu-kung, "how ye speak of a gentleman! No team overtakes the tongue! Nature is no more than art; art is no more than nature. Without the fur, a tiger or a leopard's hide is as the hide of a dog, or goat."</p>

<p>[9] Duke Ai said to Yu Jo3: "In this year of dearth I have not enough for my wants; what should be done?"</p>

<p>"Ye might tithe the people," answered Yu Jo.</p>

<p>"A fifth is all too little," said the duke; "how could a tenth avail?"</p>

<p>"When the people all live in plenty," answered Yu Jo, "will the king alone be in want? If the people are all in want, can the king alone live in plenty?"</p>

<p>[10] Tzu-chang asked how to raise the mind and scatter delusions.</p>

<p>2 Minister of Wei.       3 A disciple of Confucius.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 39</p>

<p>The Master said: "Make faithfulness and truth thy masters, and follow the right; the mind will be raised. We wish life to things we love, death to things we hate. To wish them both life and death is a delusion.</p>

<p>'Whether prompted by wealth, Yet ye made a distinction.' "</p>

<p>[n] Ching,4 Duke of Ch'i asked Confucius, What is kingcraft?</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "When the king is king and the minister is minister; when the father is father and the son is son."</p>

<p>"True indeed!" said the duke. "Were the king no> king and the minister no minister, were the father no father and the son no son, could I get aught to eat, though the grain were there?"</p>

<p>[12] The Master said: "To stint a quarrel with half a word Yu5 is the man."</p>

<p>Tzu-lu never slept over a promise.</p>

<p>[13] The Master said: "At hearing lawsuits I am no better than another. What is needed is to stay lawsuits."</p>

<p>[ 14] Tzu-chang asked, What is kingcraft ?</p>

<p>The Master said: "To be tireless of spirit and faithful at work."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "Breadth of reading and the ties of courtesy will also keep a man from error's path."</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "A gentleman shapes the good in man; he does not shape the bad in him. Contrariwise the vulgar."</p>

<p>[17] Chi K'ang6 asked Confucius how to rule.</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "To rule is to set straight. If we give an upright lead, sir, who will dare walk crooked?"</p>

<p>[18] Chi K'ang being vexed by robbers spake of it to Confucius.</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "But for your greed, sir, though ye rewarded thieves, no man would steal."</p>

<p>[19] Chi K'ang, speaking of kingcraft, said to Confucius: "To help the good, should we kill the bad?"</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "Sir, what need has a ruler to kill? Were ye set on good, sir, your people would do good. The king's mind is</p>

<p>the wind, and grass are the minds of the people: whither the wind blows, thither the grass bends."</p>

<p>[20] Tzu-chang asked, When may a scholar be called eminent?</p>

<p>The Master said: "What dost thou mean by eminence?"</p>

<p>Tzu-chang answered: "To be famous in the state, and famous in his home."</p>

<p>The Master said: "That is fame, not eminence. The eminent man is plain and straight. He loves right, weighs men's words, and scans their looks. At pains to step down to them, he will be eminent in the state, and eminent in his home. The famous man wears a mask of love, but his deeds belie it. He knows no misgivings, and fame will be his in the state and fame be his in his home."</p>

<p>[21] Whilst wandering through the Rain God's glade with the Master, Fan Ch'ih said to him: "May I ask how to raise the mind, amend evil, and scatter errors?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "A good question! Rate the task above the prize; will not the mind be raised? Fight thine own faults, not the faults of others; will not evil be mended? One angry morning to forget both self and kin, is that no error?"</p>

<p>[22] Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?</p>

<p>The Master said: "To love mankind."</p>

<p>He asked, What is wisdom ?</p>

<p>The Master said: "To know mankind."</p>

<p>Fan Ch'ih did not understand.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Exalt the straight, put aside the crooked; the crooked will grow straight."</p>

<p>Fan Ch'ih withdrew, and meeting Tzu-hsia, said to him: "I was received by the Master and asked him 'What is wisdom?' The Master answered: 'Exalt the straight, put aside the crooked; the crooked will grow straight.' What did he mean?"</p>

<p>"How rich a saying!" said Tzu-hsia. "When Shun7 was lord of the earth, he chose Kao-yao from the many, exalted him, and evil vanished. When T'ang8 was lord of the earth, he chose Yi-yin9 from</p>

<p>7 An emperor of the golden age.    8 The founder of the Shang, or Yin, dynasty.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 41</p>

<p>the many, exalted him, and evil vanished." [23] Tzu-kung asked about friends.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Talk faithfully to them: guide them with skill. If this prove vain, stop. Do not court shame."</p>

<p>[24] Tseng-tzu said: "A gentleman gathers friends by culture and props love with friendship."</p>

<p>XIII</p>

<p>[1] Tzu-lu asked how to rule.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Lead the way: take pains."</p>

<p>Asked to add more, he said: "Never flag."</p>

<p>[2] When steward of the Chi, Chung-kung asked how to rule.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Let officers act first: overlook small faults: raise worth and talent."</p>

<p>Chung-kung said: "How shall I learn to know the worth and talent I have to raise?"</p>

<p>"Raise those thou dost know," said the Master; "and those unknown to thee, will other men pass by?"</p>

<p>[3] Tzu-lu said: "The King of Wei1 looks to you, Sir, to govern. How shall ye begin?"</p>

<p>"If need were," said the Master, "by putting names right."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Tzu-lu, "that is far fetched, Sir! Why put them right?"</p>

<p>"Yu," said the Master, "thou art ill-bred. On matters beyond his ken a gentleman speaks with caution. If names are not right, words are misused. When words are misused, affairs go wrong. When affairs go wrong, courtesy and music droop. When courtesy and music droop, law and justice fail. And when law and justice fail them, a people can move neither hand nor foot. So a gentleman must be ready to put names into speech, to put words into deed. A gentleman is nowise careless of words."</p>

<p>[4] Fan Ch'ih asked to be taught husbandry.</p>

<p>see. I am one of Heaven's men whose sight is quick: it falls to me to show the way to the people.' Were there man or wife below heaven, who had missed his share in the heritage of Yao and Shun, it was to him as though his hand had pushed him into the ditch; for the burden he took upon him was the weight of all below heaven."

<p>After Fan Ch'ih had left, the Master said: "How small a man! If those above love courtesy, none will dare to slight them: if those above love right, none will dare to disobey: if those above love truth, none will dare to hide the heart. Then, from the four corners of the earth, folk will gather, their children on their backs; what need will there be for husbandry?"</p>

<p>[5] The Master said: "Though a man have conned three hundred poems; if he stand helpless when put to govern; if he cannot answer for himself, when sent to the four corners of the earth; despite their number, what have they done for him?"</p>

<p>[6] The Master said: "The man of upright life is obeyed before he speaks: commands even go unheeded where the life is crooked."</p>

<p>[7] The Master said: "The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers."</p>

<p>[8] Speaking of Ching, of the ducal house of Wei, the Master said: "He was wise in his private life. When he had begun saving, he said, 'This is much.' When he grew better off, he said 'Now we lack nothing.' And when he was rich, he said 'We live in splendour.'"</p>

<p>[9] Whilst Jan Yu was driving him on the road to Wei, the Master said: "What numbers!"</p>

<p>[15] Duke Ting asked: "Is there any one saying that can prosper a kingdom?"</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "That is more than words can do. But a proverb says 'Hard it is to be king, nor yet light to be minister.' And did one know how hard it is to be king, might not this saying all but prosper a kingdom?"</p>

<p>"And is there any one saying that can wreck a kingdom?"</p>

<p>"That is more than words can do," Confucius answered. "But a proverb says 'My one joy as king is that none withstand what I say.' Now if none withstand him when right, will it not be well ? But if none withstand him when wrong, might not this saying all but wreck a kingdom?"</p>

<p>[17] Tzu-hsia, when governor of Chu-fu, asked how to rule.</p>

<p>[18] The Duke of She told Confucius: "Among the upright men of my home if the father steal a sheep his son will bear witness."</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "Our people's uprightness is unlike that. The father screens his son, the son screens his father. There is uprightness in this."</p>

<p>[19] Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?</p>

<p>The Master said: "To be respectful at home, painstaking at work, faithful to all. Even among savages none of this may be dropped."</p>

<p>"And how are the crown servants of to-day?"</p>

<p>"What! The weights and measures men!" said the Master. "Are they worth reckoning?"</p>

<p>[21] The Master said: "As followers of the golden mean are not to be found, I have to work with ambitious and headstrong men. Ambitious men push ahead, and there are things that headstrong men will not do."</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "The men of the south say, 'Unless steadfast a man will make neither a wizard nor a leech.' This is true. 'A falling off in merit will reap disgrace.'"</p>

<p>"No," said the Master.</p>

<p>"And would it be right if a man were hated by all his neighbours?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Master. "It would be better if the good men of the neighbourhood liked him, and the bad men of the neighbourhood hated him."</p>

<p>[25] The Master said: "A gentleman is easy to serve, and hard to please. Nought but what is right pleases him: he fits his behests to the man. The vulgar are hard to serve, and easy to please. What is wrong may yet please them: but of their men they expect all things."</p>

<p>[2] "To eschew strife and boasting, spite and greed, can that be called love?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "I call that hard to do: I do not know that it is love."</p>

<p>[4] The Master said: "When right prevails, be fearless of speech and fearless in deed: when wrong prevails, be fearless in deed but soft of speech."</p>

<p>But when Nan-kung Kuo had left, the Master said: "What a gentleman he is! How he prizes worth!"</p>

<p>[7] The Master said: "Gentlemen without love there may be, but the vulgar must ever be strangers to love."</p>

<p>[11] The Master said: "It is hard not to chafe at poverty, a light thing not to be proud of wealth."</p>

<p>[12] The Master said: "Meng Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be steward to Chao or Wei, but is not fit to be minister of T'eng or Hsieh."</p>

<p>[13] Tzu-lu asked what were a full-grown man.</p>

<p>The Master said: "A man wise as Tsang Wu-chung, greedless as Kung-ch'o, bold as Chuang of Pien, skilful as Jan Ch'iu, and graced with courtesy and music, might be called a full-grown man. But to-day who asks the like of a full-grown man? Who in sight of gain remembers right, in face of danger will risk his life, and cleaves to his word for a lifetime, however old the bond, him we must call a full-grown man."</p>

<p>[14] Speaking of Kung-shu Wen, the Master said to Kung-ming Chia: "Is it true that thy master does not speak, nor laugh, nor take a gift?"</p>

<p>Kung-ming Chia answered: "That is saying too much. My master speaks when it is time to speak, so none weary of his speaking: he laughs when he is merry, so none weary of his laughter: he takes what it is right to take, so none weary of his taking."</p>

<p>"It may be so," said the Master; "but is it?"</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "When Tsang Wu-chung holding Fang asked Lu to appoint an heir, though he said that he was not forcing his prince, I cannot believe it."</p>

<p>3 See note to iii. 22.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 47</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "Duke Wen of Chin was deep, but dishonest: Duke Huan of Ch'i was honest, but shallow."</p>

<p>[17] Tzu-lu said: "When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, Shao Hu died with him, but not Kuan Chung, was this not want of love?"4</p>

<p>The Master said: "Duke Huan gathered the nobles together, without help from chariots of war, through the might of Kuan Chung. What can love do more? What can love do more?"</p>

<p>[18] Tzu-kung said: "In becoming minister, instead of dying with the young duke Chiu, when he was slain by Duke Huan, Kuan Chung showed want of love, it would seem."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Through Kuan Chung helping Duke Huan to bend the nobility, and tame the world, men have fared the better from that day unto this. But for Kuan Chung we should wear our hair down our backs and the left arm bare: or should he, like the ploughboy and his lass, their troth to keep, have drowned in a ditch, no man the wiser?"</p>

<p>[19] The minister Hsien, once steward to Kung-shu Wen, went to audience of the duke together with Wen.</p>

<p>When the Master heard of this, he said: "He is rightly called Wen (cultured)."</p>

<p>[20] The Master spake of the wickedness of Ling, Duke of Wei.</p>

<p>K'ang5 said: "If that be so, how does he escape ruin?"</p>

<p>[21] The Master said: "If the tongue have no fear, words are hard to make good."</p>

<p>4 Huan and Chiu were brothers, sons of the Duke of Ch'i. When the father died, their uncle seized the throne. To preserve the rightful heirs Shao Hu and Kuan Chung fled with Chiu to Lu, whilst Huan escaped to another state. The usurper having subsequently been murdered, Huan returned to Ch'i and secured the throne. He then required the Duke of Lu to kill his brother and deliver up to him Shao Hu and Kuan Chung. This was done. But on the way to Ch'i, Shao Hu cut his throat. Kuan Chung, on the other hand, took service under Duke Huan, became his Prime Minister, and raised the state to greatness (see note to iii. 22).</p>

<p>Confucius cleansed himself, went to court, and told Duke Ai, saying: "Ch'en Heng has murdered his prince. Pray chastise him."</p>

<p>The duke said: "Tell the three chiefs."</p>

<p>Confucius said: "Following in the wake of the ministry I dared not leave this untold; but the prince says, 'Tell the three chiefs.'" He told the three chiefs. It was vain.</p>

<p>Confucius said: "Following in the wake of the ministry I dared not leave this untold."</p>

<p>[27] The Master said: "When not in office discuss not policy."</p>

<p>[28] Tseng-tzu said: "A gentleman is bent on keeping his place."</p>

<p>[29] The Master said: "A gentleman is shamefast of speech: his deeds go further."</p>

<p>Tzu-kung replied: "That is what ye say, Sir." [31] Tzu-kung would compare one man with another. The Master said: "What talents Tz'u has! Now I have no time for this."</p>

<p>[32] The Master said: "Sorrow not at being unknown: sorrow for thine own shortcomings."</p>

<p>Confucius answered: "I dare not wag a glib tongue; but I hate stubbornness."</p>

<p>[35] The Master said: "A steed is not praised for his strength, but praised for his mettle."</p>

<p>[36] One said: "To mete out good for evil, how were that?"</p>

<p>"And how would ye meet good?" said the Master. "Meet evil with justice: meet good with good."</p>

<p>[37] The Master said: "Alas! no man knows me!"</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "Why do ye say, Sir, that no man knows you?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Never murmuring against Heaven, nor finding fault with men; learning from the lowest, cleaving the heights. I am known but to one, but to Heaven."</p>

<p>[38] Liao, the duke's uncle, spake ill of Tzu-lu to Chi-sun.7</p>

<p>Tzu-fu Ching-po told this to Confucius, saying: "My lord's mind is surely being led astray by the duke's uncle, but strength is yet mine to expose his body in the market-place."</p>

<p>The Master said: "The doom has fallen if truth is to win: it has fallen if truth is to lose. Can Liao, the duke's uncle, fight against doom?"</p>

<p>[39] The Master said: "Men of worth shun the world; the next best shun the land. Then come men who go at a look, then men who go at speech."</p>

<p>[40] The Master said: "Seven men did so."</p>

<p>[44] The Master said: "When those above love courtesy, the people are easy to lead."</p>

<p>[45] Tzu-lu asked, What is a gentleman?</p>

<p>The Master said: "A man bent on shaping his mind."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Tzu-lu.</p>

<p>"On shaping his mind to give happiness to others." "And is that all?"</p>

<p>"On shaping his mind to give happiness to the people," said the Master. "To shape the mind and give happiness to the people, for this both Yao and Shun still pined."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "Yu,2 how few know what is worthy!"</p>

<p>[4] The Master said: "To rule doing nothing, that was Shun's way. What need to be doing? Self-respect and a kingly look are all."</p>

<p>[5] Tzu-chang asked how to get on.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Be faithful and true of word; let thy walk be plain and lowly: thou wilt get on, though in savage land. If thy words be not faithful and true, thy walk plain and lowly, wilt thou get on, though in thine own home? Standing, see these words ranged before thee; driving, see them written upon the yoke. Then thou wilt get on."</p>

<p>Tzu-chang wrote them upon his girdle.</p>

<p>[6] The Master said: "Straight indeed was the historian Yii! Straight as an arrow when right prevailed, and straight as an arrow when wrong prevailed! What a gentleman was Ch'ii Po-yii! When right prevailed he took office: when wrong prevailed he rolled himself up in thought."</p>

<p>[7] The Master said: "To keep silence to him who has ears to hear is to spill the man. To speak to a man without ears to hear is to spill thy words. Wisdom spills neither man nor word."</p>

<p>[8] The Master said: "A high will, or a loving heart, will not seek life at cost of love. To fulfil love they will kill the body."</p>

<p>3 Another of these seigneurs du temps jadis who is more to us than a dim shadow, still living on in the pages of Mencius. There we learn that "He was not ashamed of a foul king, nor scorned a small post. He hid not his worth in office, but held his own way. Dismissal did not vex him; want did not make him sad. If thrown together with countrymen he felt so much at ease that he could not bear to leave them. 'Thou art thou,' he said, 'and I am I. Standing beside me with shoulders bare, or body naked, how canst thou defile me?' (V. B. 1). When pressed to stay, he stayed; for he set no store on going" (II. A. 9).</p>

<p>[28] The Master said: "The man can exalt the truth: truth cannot exalt the man."</p>

<p>[29] The Master said: "The fault is to cleave to a fault."</p>

<p>[30] The Master said: "In vain have I spent in thought whole days without food, whole nights without sleep! Study is better."</p>

<p>[31] The Master said: "A gentleman aims at truth; he does not aim at food. Ploughing may end in famine; study may end in pay. But a gentleman pines for truth: he is not pined with poverty."</p>

<p>[32] The Master said: "What the mind has won will be lost again, unless love hold it fast. A mind to understand and love to hold fast, without dignity of bearing, will go unhonoured. A mind to understand, love to hold fast and dignity of bearing are incomplete, without courteous ways."</p>

<p>[1] The Chi was about to chastise Chuan-yii.5</p>

<p>Jan Yu and Chi-lu,6 being received by Confucius, said to him: "The Chi is going to deal with Chuan-yii."</p>

<p>Confucius said: "After all, Ch'iu,7 are ye not in the wrong? The kings of old made Chuan-yii lord of Tung Meng.8 It is within the borders of the realm, moreover, and a vassal state. Ought it to be chastised?"</p>

<p>Jan Yu said: "Our lord wishes it. We, his ministers, are both against it."</p>

<p>Confucius said: "Ch'iu, Chou Jen was wont to say, 'Put forth thy strength in the ranks; leave them rather than do wrong.' Who would choose as guide one that is no prop in danger, who cannot lift him when fallen? Moreover, what thou sayest is wrong. If a tiger or a buffalo escape from the pen, if tortoiseshell or jade be broken in the case, who is to blame?"</p>

<p>Jan Yu said: "But Chuan-yii is strong, and close to Pi;9 if not seized to-day, it will bring sorrow in after times on our sons and grandsons."</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 55</p>

<p>Confucius said: "To make excuses instead of saying 'I want it' is hateful, Ch'iu, to a gentleman. I have heard that unlikeness of lot grieves a king or a chief, not fewness of men. Unrest grieves him, not poverty. Had each his share there would be no poverty. In harmony is number: peace prevents a fall. So if far off tribes will not bend, win them by encouraging worth and learning; and when they come in, give them peace. But now, when far off tribes will not bend, ye two, helpers of your lord, cannot win them. The kingdom is rent asunder; ye are too weak to defend it. Yet spear and shield ye would call up through the land! The sorrows of Chi's grandsons, I fear, will not rise in Chuan-yii: they will rise within the palace wall."</p>

<p>[2] Confucius said: "When right prevails below heaven, courtesy, music and punitive wars flow from the Son of Heaven. When wrong prevails below heaven, courtesy, music, and punitive wars flow from the feudal princes. When they flow from the feudal princes they will rarely last for ten generations. When they flow from the princes' ministers they will rarely last for five generations. When courtiers sway a country's fate, they will rarely last for three generations. When right prevails below heaven power does not lie with ministers. When right prevails below heaven common men do not argue."</p>

<p>[3] Confucius said: "For five generations its income has passed from the ducal house;10 for four generations power has lain with ministers: and humbled, therefore, are the sons and grandsons of the three Huan."</p>

<p>[4] Confucius said: "There axe three friends that do good, and three friends that do harm. The friends that do good are a straight friend, a sincere friend, and a friend who has heard much. The friends that do harm are a smooth friend, a fawning friend, and a friend with a glib tongue."</p>

<p>[5] Confucius said: "There are three joys that do good, and three joys that do harm. The joys that do good are joy in dissecting courtesy and music, joy in speaking of the good in men, and joy in a number of worthy friends. The joys that do harm are joy in pomp, joy in roving, and joy in the joys of the feast."</p>

<p>"Of Lu.</p>

<p>56 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[6] Confucius said: "Men who wait upon princes fall into three mistakes. To speak before the time has come is rashness. Not to speak when the time has come is secrecy. To speak heedless of looks is blindness."</p>

<p>[7] Confucius said: "A gentleman has three things to guard against. In the days of thy youth, ere thy strength is steady, beware of lust. When manhood is reached, in the fulness of strength, beware of strife. In old age, when thy strength is broken, beware of greed."</p>

<p>[8] Confucius said: "A gentleman holds three things in awe. He is in awe of Heaven's doom: he is in awe of great men: he is awed by the speech of the holy.</p>

<p>"The vulgar are blind to doom, and hold it not in awe. They are saucy towards the great, and of the speech of the holy they make their game."</p>

<p>[9] Confucius said: "The best men are born wise. Next come those who grow wise by learning: then, learned, narrow minds. Narrow minds, without learning, are the lowest of the people."</p>

<p>[10] Confucius said: "A gentleman has nine aims. To see clearly; to understand what he hears; to be warm in manner, dignified in bearing, faithful of speech, painstaking at work; to ask when in doubt; in anger to think of difficulties; in sight of gain to remember right."</p>

<p>[11] Confucius said: "In sight of good to be filled with longing; to regard evil as scalding to the touch: I have met such men, I have heard such words.</p>

<p>"To dwell apart and search the will; to unriddle truth by righteous life: I have heard these words, but met no such men."</p>

<p>[12] Ching, Duke of Ch'i, had a thousand teams of horses; but the people, on his death day, found nought in him to praise. Po-yi11 and Shu-ch'i starved at the foot of Shou-yang, and men to-day still sound their praises.</p>

<p>Is not this the clue to that?</p>

<p>[13] Ch'en K'ang12 asked Po-yii:13 "Apart from us, have ye heard aught, Sir?"</p>

<p>He answered: "No. Once as I sped across the hall, where my father stood alone, he said to me: 'Dost thou study poetry?' I 11 See note to v. 22.    12 The disciple Tzu-ch'in.    13 Confucius' son.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 57</p>

<p>answered, 'No.' 'Who does not study poetry,' he said, 'has no hold on words.' I withdrew and studied poetry.</p>

<p>"Another day as I sped across the hall, where he stood alone, he said to me: 'Dost thou study courtesy?' I answered, 'No.' 'Who does not study courtesy,' he said, 'loses all foothold.' I withdrew and studied courtesy. These two things I have heard."</p>

<p>Ch'en K'ang withdrew and cried gladly: "I asked one thing and get three! I hear of poetry: I hear of courtesy: and I hear, too, that a gentleman keeps aloof from his son."</p>

<p>[14] A king speaks of his wife as "my lady." She calls herself "handmaid." Her subjects call her "our royal lady." Speaking to foreigners they say, "our little queen." Foreigners also call her "the royal lady."</p>

<p>[1] Yang Huo1 wished to see Confucius. Confucius did not visit him. He sent Confucius a sucking pig. Confucius chose a time when he was out, and went to thank him. They met on the road.</p>

<p>He said to Confucius: "Come, let us speak together. To cherish a gem and undo the kingdom, is that love?"</p>

<p>"It is not," said Confucius.</p>

<p>"To be fond of power and let each chance of office slip, is that wisdom?" "It is not," said Confucius.</p>

<p>"The days and months glide by; the years do not tarry for us."</p>

<p>"True," said Confucius; "I must take office."</p>

<p>[2] The Master said: "Men are near to each other at birth: the lives they lead sunder them."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "Only the wisest and the stupidest of men never change."</p>

<p>[4] As the Master drew near to Wu-ch'eng2 he heard sounds of lute and song.</p>

<p>"Why use an ox-knife to kill a fowl?" said the Master, with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>Tzu-yu answered: "Master, I have heard you say of yore: 'A</p>

<p>'The all-powerful, unscrupulous minister of the Chi.</p>

<p>gentleman who has conned the truth will love mankind; poor folk who have conned the truth are easy to rule.'"</p>

<p>"My boys," said the Master, "Yen3 is right. I spake before in play."</p>

<p>[5] Kung-shan Fu-jao4 held Pi in rebellion. He summoned the Master, who fain would have gone.</p>

<p>Tzu-lu said in displeasure: "This cannot be. Why must ye go to Kung-shan?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "This lord summons me, and would that be all? Could I not make an Eastern Chou5 of him that employed me?"</p>

<p>[6] Tzu-chang asked Confucius, What is love? "Love," said Confucius, "is to mete out five things to all below heaven." "May I ask what they are?"</p>

<p>"Modesty and bounty," said Confucius, "truth, earnestness, and kindness. Modesty escapes insult; bounty wins the many; truth gains men's trust; earnestness brings success; kindness is the key to men's work."</p>

<p>[7] Pi Hsi summoned the Master, who fain would have gone.</p>

<p>Tzu-lu said: "Master, I have heard you say of yore: 'When the man in touch with the soul does evil, a gentleman stands aloof.' Pi Hsi holds Chung-mou in rebellion: how, Sir,could ye join him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I said so," answered the Master. "But is not a thing called hard that cannot be ground thin; white, if steeping will not turn it black? and am I a gourd? can I hang without eating?"</p>

<p>[8] The Master said: "Hast thou heard the six words, Yu,6 or the six they sink into?"</p>

<p>He answered: "No."</p>

<p>"Sit down that I may tell thee. The thirst for love, without love of learning, sinks into fondness. Love of knowledge, without love of learning, sinks into presumption. Love of truth, without love of learning, sinks into cruelty. Love of uprightness, without love of learning, sinks into harshness. Love of courage, without love of learning, sinks into turbulence. Love of strength, without love of learning, sinks into oddity."</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 59</p>

<p>[9] The Master said: "My boys, why do ye not study poetry? Poetry would ripen you; teach you insight, fellow-feeling, and forbearance; show you first your duty to your father, then your duty to the king; and would teach you the names of many birds and beasts, plants and trees."</p>

<p>[10] The Master said to Po-yii7: "Hast thou conned the Chou-nan8 and Shao-nan?8 Who has not conned the Chou-nan and Shao-nan is as a man standing with his face to the wall."</p>

<p>[11] The Master said: "'Courtesy, courtesy,' is the cry: but are jade and silk the whole of courtesy? 'Harmony, harmony,' is the cry: but are bells and drums the whole of harmony?"</p>

<p>[12] The Master said: "A fierce outside and a weak core, is it not like a paltry fellow, like a thief who crawls through a hole in the wall?"</p>

<p>[13] The Master said: "The bane of all things noble is the pattern citizen."</p>

<p>[14] The Master said: "To proclaim each truth, as soon as learned to the highwayside, is to lay waste the soul."</p>

<p>[15] The Master said: "How can one serve the king with a sordid colleague, itching to get what he wants, trembling to lose what he has? This trembling to lose what he has may lead him anywhere."</p>

<p>[16] The Master said: "Men of old had three failings, which have, perhaps, died out to-day. Ambitious men of old were not nice: ambitious men to-day are unprincipled. Masterful men of old were rough: masterful men to-day are quarrelsome. Simple men of old were straight: simple men to-day are false. That is all."</p>

<p>[17] The Master said: "Honeyed words and flattering looks seldom speak of love."</p>

<p>[18] The Master said: "I hate the ousting of scarlet by purple. I hate the strains of Cheng, confounders of sweet music. I hate a sharp tongue, the ruin of kingdom and home."</p>

<p>[19] The Master said: "I long for silence."</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "If ye, Sir, were silent, what would your disciples have to tell?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Does Heaven speak ? The seasons four revolve, and all things multiply. Does Heaven speak?"</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[20] Ju Pei wished to see Confucius. Confucius excused himself on the plea of sickness. As the messenger went out, Confucius took a lute and sang to it, so that he should hear.</p>

<p>[21] Tsai Wo9 asked about the three years'mourning. He thought one enough.</p>

<p>"If for three years pomp is scouted by the gentry, will not courtesy suffer ? If music stop for three years, will not music decay ? The old grain vanishes, the new springs up; the round of woods for the fire-drill is ended in one year."</p>

<p>The Master said: "Feeding on rice, clad in brocade, couldst thou feel happy?"</p>

<p>"I could feel happy," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then do what makes thee happy. A gentleman, when in mourning, has no taste for sweets, no ear for music; he is unhappy in his home. And so he forsakes these things. But since thou art happy in them, keep them."</p>

<p>When Tsai Wo had left, the Master said: "A man without love! At the age of three a child first leaves his parents' arms, and three years is the time for mourning everywhere below heaven. But did Yii10 enjoy for three years a father's and a mother's love?"</p>

<p>[22] The Master said: "Bad it is when a man eats his fill all day, and has nought to task the mind! Could he not play at chequers? Even that were better."</p>

<p>[23] Tzu-lu said: "Does a gentleman honour courage?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "Right comes first for a gentleman. Courage, without sense of right, makes rebels of the great, and robbers of the poor."</p>

<p>[24] Tzu-kung said: "Does a gentleman also hate?"</p>

<p>"He does," said the Master. "He hates the sounding of evil deeds; he hates men of low estate who slander their betters; he hates courage without courtesy; he hates daring matched with blindness."</p>

<p>"And Tz'u," 11 he added, "dost thou hate too?"</p>

<p>"I hate those who mistake spying for wisdom. I hate those who take want of deference for courage. I hate evil speaking, cloaked as honesty."</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 61</p>

<p>[25] The Master said: "Only girls and servants are hard to train. Draw near to them, they grow unruly; hold them off, they pay you with spite."</p>

<p>[26] The Master said: "When a man of forty is hated, it will be so to the end."</p>

<p>XVIII</p>

<p>[1] The lord of Wei1 went into exile, the lord of Ch'i became a slave, Pi-kan1 died for his reproofs. Confucius said: "In three of the Yin there was love." [2] When Liu-hsia Hui2 was judge he was thrice dismissed. Men said: "Why not leave, Sir?"</p>

<p>He answered: "Whither could I go and not be thrice dismissed for upright service? To do crooked service what need to leave the land of my forefathers?"</p>

<p>[3] Ching, Duke of Ch'i, speaking of how to treat Confucius, said: "I could not treat him as I do the Chi. I should set him between Chi and Meng."</p>

<p>Again he said: "I am old: I have no use for him."</p>

<p>Confucius went his way.</p>

<p>[4] Chi Huan accepted a gift of singing girls from the men of Ch'i.3 For three days no court was held. Confucius went his way.</p>

<p>[5] Chieh-yu, the mad-head of Ch'u, as he passed Confucius sang:</p>

<p>"Phoenix, bright phcenix,</p>

<p>Thy glory is ended! Think of the future:</p>

<p>The past can't be mended. Up and away! The court is to-day</p>

<p>With danger attended."</p>

<p>Confucius alighted and fain would have spoken with him. But hurriedly he made off: no speech was to be had of him.</p>

<p>1 Kinsman of Chou, the last tyrannical emperor of the house of Yin.</p>

<p>2 See note to xv. 13.</p>

<p>8 b.c. 497. The turning point in Confucius' career. Sorrowfully the Master left office and his native land and went forth to twelve years of wandering in exile.</p>

<p>62 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>[6] Ch'ang-chu and Chieh-ni were working together in the fields. Confucius, as he passed by, sent Tzu-lu to ask after a ford. Ch'ang-chu said: "Who is that holding the reins?" "K'ung Ch'iu,"4 answered Tzu-lu. "What, K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?" "The same," said Tzu-lu. "He knows the ford," said Ch'ang-chu. Tzu-lu asked Chieh-ni. "Who are ye, sir?" he answered. "I am Chung Yu."</p>

<p>"The disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?" "Yes," said Tzu-lu.</p>

<p>"The world is one seething torrent," answered Chieh-ni, "what man can guide it? Were it not better to choose a master who flees the world, than a master who flees this man and that man?"</p>

<p>And he went on hoeing without stop.</p>

<p>Tzu-lu went back and told the Master, whose face fell.</p>

<p>"Can I herd with birds and beasts?" he said. "Whom but these men can I choose as fellows ? And if all were right with the world, I should have no call to set it straight."</p>

<p>[7] Tzu-lu having fallen behind met an old man bearing a basket on his staff.</p>

<p>Tzu-lu asked him: "Have ye seen the Master, Sir?" The old man answered: "Thou dost not toil with thy limbs, nor canst thou tell one grain from another; who is thy Master?" And planting his staff in the ground, he began weeding. Tzu-lu bowed and stood before him.</p>

<p>He kept Tzu-lu for the night, killed a fowl, prepared millet, feasted him, and presented his two sons.</p>

<p>On the morrow Tzu-lu went to the Master, and told what had happened.</p>

<p>The Master said: "He is in hiding."</p>

<p>He sent Tzu-lu back to see him; but when he reached the house the man had left.</p>

<p>Tzu-lu said: "Not to take office is wrong. If the ties of old and young are binding, why should the claim of king on minister be</p>

<p>4 Confucius.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 63</p>

<p>set aside? Wishing to keep his person clean, he flouts a foremost duty. A gentleman takes office at the call of right, aware though he be, that the cause is lost."</p>

<p>[8] Po-yi, Shu-ch'i, Yii-chung, Yi-yi, Chu-chang, Liu-hsia Hui and Shao-lien were men who fled the world.</p>

<p>The Master said: "Po-yi5 and Shu-ch'i would not bend the will, or shame the body.</p>

<p>"We can but say that Liu-hsia Hui6 and Shao-lien bent the will and shamed the body. Their words jumped with duty; their deeds answered our hopes.</p>

<p>"We may say of Yii-chung and Yi-yi that they lived in hiding, but gave the rein to the tongue. They were clean in person: their retreat was timely.</p>

<p>"But I am unlike all of these: I know not 'must' or 'must not.'"</p>

<p>[9] Chih, the chief Musical Conductor, went to Ch'i; Kan, the Conductor at the second meal, went to Ch'u; Liao, the Conductor at the third meal, went to Ts'ai; Chiieh, the Conductor at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in. The drum master Fang-shu crossed the river; the tambourine master Wu crossed the Han; Yang, the assistant Bandmaster, and Hsiang, who played the sounding stones, crossed the sea.</p>

<p>[10] The Duke of Chou7 said to the Duke of Lu:8 "A prince does not forsake kinsmen, nor offend great vassals by neglect. He will not discard an old servant, unless he have big cause. He asks perfection of no man."</p>

<p>[11] Chou had eight officers: Po-ta and Po-kuo, Chung-tu and Chung-hu, Shu-yeh and Shu-hsia, Chi-sui and Chi-kua.</p>

<p>XIX</p>

<p>[1] Tzu-chang said: "The scholar who in danger will stake his life, who in sight of gain remembers right, who is lowly in heart at worship, and sad at heart when mourning, may pass muster."</p>

<p>[2] Tzu-chang said: "Goodness blindly clutched, faith that lacks simplicity, can they be said to be, or said not to be?"</p>

<p>[3] The disciples of Tzu-hsia asked Tzu-chang about friendship. 5 See note to v. 22.     6 See note to xv. 13.    7 See note to vii. 5.    8 His son.</p>

<p>64 THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>Tzu-chang said: "What does Tzu-hsia say?"</p>

<p>They answered: "Tzu-hsia says: 'Cling to worthy friends; push the unworthy away.'"</p>

<p>Tzu-chang said: "I was taught otherwise. A gentleman honours worth, and bears with the many. He applauds goodness, and pities weakness. Am I a man of great worth, what could I not bear with in men ? Am I a man without worth, men will push me away. Why should I push others away?"</p>

<p>[4] Tzu-hsia said: "Though there is no trade without interest, a gentleman will not follow one, lest it clog the mind at length."</p>

<p>[5] Tzu-hsia said: "Who recalls each day what fails him, who each month forgets nothing won, he may indeed be called fond of learning!"</p>

<p>[6] Tzu-hsia said: "Through wide learning and singleness of aim, through keen questions and searchings of heart we come to love."</p>

<p>[7] Tzu-hsia said: "To learn their trade apprentices work in a shop: by study a gentleman reaches the truth."</p>

<p>[8] Tzu-hsia said: "The vulgar always gloss their faults."</p>

<p>[9] Tzu-hsia said: "A gentleman alters thrice. Seen from afar he looks stern: as we draw near, he thaws: but the sound of his words is sharp."</p>

<p>[10] Tzu-hsia said: "A gentleman lays no burdens on the people until they have learned to trust him. Unless they trusted him they would think him cruel. Until he is trusted he does not reprove. Unless he were trusted it would seem fault-finding."</p>

<p>[11] Tzu-hsia said: "If we keep within the bounds of honour, we may step to and fro through propriety."</p>

<p>[12] Tzu-yu said: "The disciples, the boys of Tzu-hsia, can sprinkle and sweep the floor, answer when spoken to, and enter or leave a room; but what can come of branches without root?"</p>

<p>When Tzu-hsia heard this, he said: "Yen Yu1 is wrong. In training a gentleman, because we teach one thing first, shall we flag before reaching the next ? Thus plants and trees vary in size. Should a gentleman's training bewilder him ? To absorb it first and last none but the holy are fit."</p>

<p>[13] Tzu-hsia said: "Crown servants should use their spare</p>

<p>1 Tzu-yu.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 65</p>

<p>strength for study. A scholar with his spare strength should serve the crown."</p>

<p>[14] Tzu-yu said: "Mourning should stretch to grief, and stretch no further."</p>

<p>[15] Tzu-yu said: "My friend Chang2 can do things that are hard, but he is void of love."</p>

<p>[16] Tseng-tzu said: "So magnificent is Chang that to do as love bids is hard when at his side."</p>

<p>[17] Tseng-tzu said: "I have heard the Master say: 'Man never shows what is in him unless when mourning one near to him.'"</p>

<p>[18] Tseng-tzu said: "I have heard the Master say: 'In all else we may rival the piety of Meng Chuang, but in not changing his father's ministers, or his father's rule, he is hard to rival.' "</p>

<p>[19] The Meng3 made Yang Fu4 criminal judge, who asked Tseng-tzu about his duties.</p>

<p>Tseng-tzu said: "The gentry have lost their way, and the people long been distraught. When thou dost get at the heart of a crime, be moved to pity, not puffed with joy."</p>

<p>[20] Tzu-kung said: "The wickedness of Chou5 was not so great. Thus let princes beware of living in a sink, where the filth of the world all streams together!"</p>

<p>[21] Tzu-kung said: "The faults of a prince are like the darkening of sun or moon. The fault is seen of all, and when he breaks free all men admire."</p>

<p>[22] Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tzu-kung: "Where did Chung-ni6 get his learning?"</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "The lore of Wen and Wu has not fallen into ruin, but lives in men: the big in big men, the small in small men. No man is empty of the lore of Wen and Wu. How should the Master not learn it? What need had he for a set teacher?"</p>

<p>[23] Shu-sun Wu-shu,7 talking to some lords at court, said: "Tzu-kung is a greater man than Chung-ni."8</p>

<p>Tzu-fu Ching-po told this to Tzu-kung.</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "This is like the palace and its wall. My wall reaches to the shoulder. Peeping over one sees the goodly home</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</p>

<p>within. The Master's wall is many fathoms high. Unless he enter the gate, no man can see the beauty of the Ancestral Temples, the wealth of the hundred officers. And if but few men gain the gate, is my lord not right to speak as he does?" [24] Shu-sun Wu-shu decried Chung-ni.</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "It is labour lost. Chung-ni cannot be cried down. The greatness of other men is a mound that can be overleaped. Chung-ni is the sun or moon that no man can overleap. To run into death though a man were ready, how could he hurt the sun or moon? His want of sense would but show the better!"</p>

<p>[25] Ch'en Tzu-ch'in9 said to Tzu-kung: "Sir, your humility is overdone. In what way is Chung-ni your better?"</p>

<p>Tzu-kung said: "By a word a gentleman betrays wisdom, by a word his want of wisdom. Words are not to be lightly spoken. None can come up to the Master, as heaven is not to be climbed by steps. Had the Master power in the land, the saying would come true: 'All that he plants takes root; whither he leads men follow. The peace he brings draws men; his touch tunes them to harmony: honored in life, he is mourned when dead.' Who can come up to him?"</p>

<p>XX</p>

<p>[i]1 Yao said: "Hail to thee, Shun! The number that the Heavens are telling falls on thee. Keep true hold of the golden mean. Should there be stress or want within the four seas, the gift of Heaven will pass for ever."</p>

<p>Shun laid the same commands on Yii.</p>

<p>Tang said: "I, Thy child Li, make bold to offer this black steer, and make bold to proclaim before Thee, Almighty Lord, that I dare not forgive sin, nor hold down Thy servants. Search them, oh Lord, in Thine heart. Visit not my sins on the ten thousand hamlets: the sins of the ten thousand hamlets visit upon my head."</p>

<p>Chou bestowed great gifts, and good men grew rich.</p>

<p>9 The disciple Tzu-ch'in.</p>

<p>1 This chapter shows the principles on which China was governed in ancient days. Yao and Shun were the legendary founders of the Chinese Empire. Yii, T'ang, and Chou were the first emperors of the houses of Hsia, Shang, and Chou, which had ruled China up to the time of Confucius.</p>

<p>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS 67</p>

<p>"Loving hearts are better than men that are near of kin. All the people throw the blame upon me alone."2</p>

<p>He attended to weights and measures, revised the laws, and restored broken officers. On all sides order reigned. He revived states that had perished, and gave back fiefs that had reverted. He called forth men from hiding. All hearts below heaven turned to him. The people's food, burials, and worship he held to be of moment. His bounty gained the many; his truth won the people's trust; his earnestness brought success; his justice made men glad.</p>

<p>[2] Tzu-chang asked Confucius: "How should men be governed?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "He who would govern men must honour the five graces, spurn the four vices."</p>

<p>Tzu-chang said: "What are the five graces?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "A gentleman is kind, but not wasteful; he burdens, but does not embitter; he is covetous, not sordid; high-minded, not proud; he inspires awe, and not fear."</p>

<p>Tzu-chang said: "What is meant by kindness without waste?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "To further what furthers the people, is not that kindness without waste ? If burdens be sorted to strength, who will grumble? To covet love and win love, is that sordid? Few or many, small or great, all is one to a gentleman: he dare not slight any man. Is not this to be high-minded and not proud ? A gentleman straightens his robe and settles his face. He is stern, and men look up to him with dread. Is not this to inspire awe, and not fear?"</p>

<p>Tzu-chang said: "What are the four vices?"</p>

<p>The Master said: "To leave untaught and then kill is cruelty: to ask full tale without warning is tyranny: to give careless orders, and be strict when the day comes is robbery: to be stingy in rewarding men is littleness."</p>

<p>[3] The Master said: "A man who is blind to doom can be no gentleman. Without a knowledge of courtesy we must want foothold. Without a knowledge of words there is no understanding men."</p>

<p>2Said by King Wu (Chou). The people blamed him for not dethroning at once the infamous tyrant Chou Hsin.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The Book of Job is one of the great masterpieces, not only of Hebrew, but of all literature. The vividness of its pictures, the rapidity of its narrative, the poignancy of its lyric passages, the passionate boldness of its attack on one of the great universal problems of human life, all raise it to the level of the highest achievements in the literature of any tongue.</p>

<p>As a book, it is difficult to classify. Its prologue and epilogue are narrative prose; and though the poetical dialogue of the central part of the work at first suggests drama, there is no action portrayed in the speeches, and they are in themselves sometimes didactic and argumentative, often lyrical, hardly at all strictly dramatic. There can scarcely be any doubt that the author's main interest was in the solution of the problem suggested by the spectacle of the righteous man in distress.</p>

<p>Of the authorship, nothing is known. Moses, Solomon, Isaiah, Job himself, and many others have been suggested, but none of them on grounds worthy of consideration. It has been thought that the story of Job's experiences may have long existed in popular form; and that this old folk-tale may have been taken up by some unknown author who saw its possibilities, and who, with superb artistic power and a profound sense of the mystery of life, retold the incidents and added the elaborate speeches of Job, of his friends, and finally of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Job himself is pictured as belonging to patriarchal times, and living, not in Palestine, but in the land of Uz, probably to the east, on the borders of Arabia. The period of the author has been very variously conjectured, and may have been as late as 400 B. C.</p>

<p>The authenticity of several parts of the work has been disputed, the speech of Elihu especially being regarded by many modern scholars for various and weighty reasons as a later interpolation.</p>

<p>THE BOOK OF JOB</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>[i]</p>

<p>THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was1 Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil. [2] And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. [3] His2 substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. [4] And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. [5] And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced3 God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>

<p>[6] Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan4 also came among them. [7] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. [8] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job ? for5 there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil. [9] Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? [10] Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side ? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. [11] But put forth thy</p>

<p>1 Heb. lyob.    2 Or, cattle.    3 Or, blasphemed. So ver. 11; ch. 2. 5, 9. 4 That is, the Adversary.    5 Or, that.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>72 JOB</p>

<p>hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face. [12] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power;6 only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</p>

<p>[13] And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, [14] that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them; [15] and the7 Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants8 with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. [16] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants,8 and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. [17] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell9 upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants8 with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. [18] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; [19] and, behold, there came a great wind from10 the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>

<p>[20] Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; [21] and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah. [22] In all this Job sinned not, nor charged" God foolishly.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>[1] Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah. [2] And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah,</p>

<p>6 Heb. hand.    7 Heb. Sheba.    8 Heb. young men.    9 Or, made a raid. 10 Or, over.    11 Or, attributed folly to God.</p>

<p>Job 73</p>

<p>and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. [3] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for1 there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to2 destroy him without cause. [4] And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. [5] But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face. [6] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.</p>

<p>[7] So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. [8] And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes. [9] Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die. [10] But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish3 women speaketh. What ? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>

<p>[11] Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. [12] And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. [13] So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>

<p>Ill</p>

<p>[1]    After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>

<p>[2] And Job answered and said:</p>

<p>[3] Let the day perish wherein I was born,</p>

<p>And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</p>

<p>1 Or, that.    2 Heb. to swallow him up.    3 Or, impious.    4 Or, pain.</p>

<p>74 JOB</p>

<p>[4] Let that day be darkness;</p>

<p>Let not God from above seek for it,</p>

<p>Neither let the light shine upon it. [5] Let darkness and the1 shadow of death claim it for their own;</p>

<p>Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it. [6] As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months. [7] Lo, let that night be barren;2</p>

<p>Let no joyful voice come therein. [8] Let them curse it that curse the day,</p>

<p>Who are ready3 to rouse up leviathan. [9] Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning: [10] Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb,</p>

<p>Nor hid trouble from mine eyes. [11] Why died I not from the womb?</p>

<p>Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me ? [12] Why did the knees receive me?</p>

<p>Or why the breasts, that I should suck ? [13] For now should I have lain down and been quiet;</p>

<p>1 should have slept; then had I been at rest, [14] With kings and counsellors of the earth,</p>

<p>Who built4 up waste places for themselves; [15] Or with princes that had gold,</p>

<p>Who filled their houses with silver: [16] Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been;</p>

<p>As infants that never saw light. [17] There the wicked cease from troubling;5</p>

<p>And there the weary are at rest. [18] There the prisoners are at ease together;</p>

<p>They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</p>

<p>'Or, deep darkness (and so elsewhere).</p>

<p>2 Or, solitary,    3 Or, skilful.    4 Or, built solitary piles.    5 Or, raging.</p>

<p>job 75</p>

<p>The small and the great are there; And the servant is free from his master.</p>

<p>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,</p>

<p>And life unto the bitter in soul;</p>

<p>Who long" for death, but it cometh not,</p>

<p>And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>

<p>Who rejoice exceedingly,7</p>

<p>And are glad, when they can find the grave ?</p>

<p>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,</p>

<p>And whom God hath hedged in?</p>

<p>For my sighing cometh before81 eat,</p>

<p>And my groanings9 are poured out like water.</p>

<p>For the10 thing which I fear cometh upon me,</p>

<p>And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</p>

<p>I am11 not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;</p>

<p>But trouble cometh.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands. Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble1 knees. But now it is come unto thee, and thou2 faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, And the integrity of thy ways thy hope? Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent ? Or where were the upright cut off? According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble,3 reap the same.</p>

<p>6 Heb. wait.    7 Or, unto exultation.    8 Or, li\e my food. 9 Heb. roarings.    10 Or, the thing which I feared is come, &c. 11 Or, was not at ease . . . yet trouble came. 1 Heb. bowing.    2 Or, art grieved.    3 Or, mischief.</p>

<p>j6 JOB</p>

<p>[1]    Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn ?</p>

<p>4 Heb. brought by stealth.    8 Or, a breath passed over.</p>

<p>6 Or, / heard a still voice.    7 Or, be just before God.</p>

<p>8 Or, be pure before his Maker.    9 Or, like. 10 Or, From morning to evening.    11 Heb. broken in pieces. 12 Or, Is not their excellency which is in them removed?</p>

<p>[9] By the breath of God they perish,</p>

<p>And by the blast of his anger are they consumed. [10] The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken. The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</p>

<p>[12]    Now a thing was secretly4 brought to me,</p>

<p>And mine ear received a whisper thereof. [13] In thoughts from the visions of the night,</p>

<p>When deep sleep falleth on men, [14] Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake. Then a5 spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up. [16] It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes: There6 was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, [17] Shall mortal man be7 more just than God? Shall a man be8 more pure than his Maker? Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly: [19] How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before9 the moth! [20] Betwixt10 morning and evening they are destroyed:'1</p>

<p>They perish for ever without any regarding it. [21] Is12 not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.</p>

<p>JOB</p>

<p>For vexation killeth the foolish man,</p>

<p>And jealousy1 slayeth the silly one.</p>

<p>I have seen the foolish taking root:</p>

<p>But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>

<p>His children are far from safety,</p>

<p>And they are crushed in the gate,</p>

<p>Neither is there any to deliver them:</p>

<p>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,</p>

<p>And taketh it even out of the thorns;</p>

<p>And the2 snare gapeth for their substance.</p>

<p>For affliction3 cometh not forth from the dust,</p>

<p>Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>

<p>But man is born unto trouble,</p>

<p>As the4 sparks fly upward.</p>

<p>But as for me, I would seek unto God,</p>

<p>And unto God would I commit my cause;</p>

<p>Who doeth great things and unsearchable,</p>

<p>Marvellous things without number:</p>

<p>Who giveth rain upon the earth,</p>

<p>And sendeth waters upon the fields;</p>

<p>So that he setteth up on high those that are low,</p>

<p>And those that mourn are exalted to safety.</p>

<p>He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,</p>

<p>So that their hands cannot5 perform their enterprise.</p>

<p>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness;</p>

<p>And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong:</p>

<p>They meet with darkness in the day-time,</p>

<p>And grope at noonday as in the night.</p>

<p>But he saveth from the sword of6 their mouth,</p>

<p>Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</p>

<p>So the poor hath hope,</p>

<p>And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>

<p>Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. [18] For he maketh sore, and bindeth up;</p>

<p>He woundeth, and his hands make whole. [19] He will deliver thee in six troubles;</p>

<p>Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. [20] In famine he will redeem thee from death;</p>

<p>And in war from the power of the sword. [21] Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;</p>

<p>Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. [22] At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh;</p>

<p>Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. [23] For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;</p>

<p>And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. [24] And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;</p>

<p>And thou shalt visit thy fold,8 and shalt9 miss nothing. [25] Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,</p>

<p>And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. [26] Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,</p>

<p>[1]    Then Job answered and said,</p>

<p>[2] Oh that my vexation were but weighed,</p>

<p>And all my calamity laid in the balances! [3] For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas:</p>

<p>Therefore have my words been rash. [4] For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,</p>

<p>The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up:</p>

<p>The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. [5] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?</p>

<p>That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! iol And be it still my consolation,</p>

<p>Yea,3 let me exult4 in pain that5 spareth not, That I have not denied6 the words of the Holy One. 111 What is my strength, that I should wait?</p>

<p>And what is mine end, that I should be patient ? 121 Is my strength the strength of stones ?</p>

<p>Or is my flesh of brass ? 13J Is it not that I have no help in me,</p>

<p>And that wisdom is driven quite from me ?</p>

<p>To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend; Even7 to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 15J My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,</p>

<p>As the channel of brooks that pass away; 16I Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself: 17J What time they wax8 warm, they vanish;</p>

<p>When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. The9 caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish. 19J The caravans of Tema looked,</p>

<p>The companies of Sheba waited for them. 20I They were put to shame because they had hoped;</p>

<p>Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as11 wind ? Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend. Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For12 surely I shall not lie to your face. Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my13 cause is righteous.

<p>Is there not a warfare1 to man upon earth ? And are not his days like the days of a hireling? As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages: So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone ? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>

<p>Oh remember that my life is a breath:</p>

<p>The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;</p>

<p>Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</p>

<p>He shall return no more to his house,</p>

<p>Neither shall his place know him any more.</p>

<p>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me ? When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint; Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions: So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones. I3 loathe my life; I would4 not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.5 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him, And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment? How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle ? If I have sinned, what do61 unto thee, O thou watcher7 of men ? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself?</p>

<p>Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness ? [4] If1 thy children have sinned against him,</p>

<p>And make thy supplication to the Almighty; [6] If thou wert pure and upright:</p>

If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth7 shall others spring. Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers. He8 will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting. They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>Then Job answered and said, Of a truth I know that it is so: But1 how can man be just with2 God? IP he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand. He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered? Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger; That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble; That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars; That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves4 of the sea; That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south; That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number.</p>

<p>And choose out my words to reason with him ? [15] Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;</p>

<p>I would make supplication to my judge. [16] If I had called, and he had answered me,</p>

<p>Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice. [17] For8 he breaketh me with a tempest,</p>

Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; Look away from him, that he may rest,3 Till he shall accomplish,4 as a hireling, his day.</p>

<p>For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again. And that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground; Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.</p>

<p>and where is he ? As the waters fail5 from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up; So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.</p>

<p>Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would61 wait, Till my release7 should come.</p>

<p>The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth:</p>

<p>So thou destroyest the hope of man. [20] Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;</p>

<p>Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. [21] His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not;</p>

<p>And Job again took up his parable, and said, As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed1 my soul; (For2 my life is yet whole in me, And the Spirit of God is in my nostrils); Surely my lips shall3 not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall4 my tongue utter deceit. Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall5 not reproach me so long as I live. Let mine enemy be as the wicked,</p>

<p>And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.</p>

<p>For what is the hope of the godless, though6 he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul? Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him ? Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times ? I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?</p>

<p>This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:</p>

<p>If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.</p>

<p>And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. [11] For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;</p>

<p>And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me: [12] Because I delivered the poor that cried,</p>

<p>The fatherless also, that6 had none to help him.

If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee. If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</p>

<p>Moreover Elihu answered and said, Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food. Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good. For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right: Notwithstanding1 my right I am accounted a liar; My2 wound is incurable, though I am without transgression What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water, Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men? For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight3 himself with God.</p>

<p>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways. Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</p>

<p>[13] Who gave him a charge over the earth?</p>

<p>// he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; [15] All flesh shall perish together,</p>

<p>And man shall turn again unto dust. [16] If7 now thou hast understanding, hear this:</p>

<p>Hearken to the voice of my words. [17] Shall even one that hateth justice govern?</p>

<p>And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty ? [18] Him* that saith to a king, Thou art vile,</p>

<p>Or to nobles, Ye are wicked; [19] That respeoteth not the persons of princes,</p>

<p>Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;</p>

<p>For they all are the work of his hands. [20] In a moment they die, even9 at midnight;</p>

<p>The people are shaken and pass away,</p>

<p>And the mighty are taken away without hand.</p>

<p>[21] For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,</p>

<p>And he seeth all his goings. [22] There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,</p>

<p>Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. [23] For he needeth not further to consider a man,</p>

<p>That he should go before God in judgment. [24] He breaketh in pieces mighty men in10 ways past finding out,</p>

<p>And setteth others in their stead. [25] Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;</p>

<p>And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.11</p>

<p>[27] Because they turned aside from following him,</p>

<p>And would not have regard to any of his ways: [28] So13 that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him,</p>

<p>And he heard the cry of the afflicted. [29] When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn ?</p>

<p>And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</p>

<p>Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man: [30] That the godless man reign not,</p>

<p>That there be none to ensnare the people.</p>

<p>[31 ]    For hath any said unto God, 1 have borne chastisement,</p>

<p>I14 will not offend any more: [32] That which I see not teach thou me:</p>

<p>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more? [33] Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it?</p>

<p>For thou must choose, and not I:</p>

<p>Therefore speak what thou knowest. [34] Men of understanding will say unto me,</p>

<p>Yea, every wise man that heareth me: [35] J0D speaketh without knowledge,</p>

<p>And his words are without wisdom. [36] Would that Job were tried unto the end,</p>

<p>Because of his answering like wicked men. [37] For he addeth rebellion unto his sin;</p>

<p>He clappeth his hands among us,</p>

<p>And multiplieth his words against God.</p>

<p>XXXV</p>

<p>[1]    Moreover Elihu answered and said, [2] Thinkest thou this to be thy right,</p>

<p>Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God's, [3] That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee?</p>

<p>And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? [4] I will answer thee,</p>

<p>And thy companions with thee.</p>

<p>13 Or, That they might cause . . . And that he might hear.</p>

<p>Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou. If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>

<p>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him ? Or what receiveth he of thy hand ? Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.</p>

<p>By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night; Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens? There they cry, but1 none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men. Surely God will not hear an empty cry, Neither will the Almighty regard it. How much less when thou sayest thou2 beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him! But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither3 doth he greatly regard arrogance; Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>

<p>XXXVI</p>

<p>Elihu also proceeded, and said, Suffer4 me a little, and I will show thee; For I5 have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf. I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>

<p>1 Or, but he answereth not. 2 Or, thou beholdest him not! The cause is before him; therefore wait thou for him.</p>

<p>3 Or, Thou sayest, He doth not greatly regard arrogance. Thus doth &c. 1 Heb. Wait for.    5 Heb. there are yet words for God.</p>

<p>JOB 139</p>

<p>[8] Lay thy hand upon him;</p>

<p>Remember the battle, and do so no more. [9] Behold, the hope of him is in vain:</p>

<p>Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him ? 110] None is so fierce that he dare stir him up;</p>

<p>Who then is he that can stand before me ? 11] Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>

<p>[ 12] I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,</p>

<p>Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. 13] Who can strip8 off his outer garment?</p>

<p>Who shall come within his jaws? [14] Who can open the doors of his face?</p>

<p>Round9 about his teeth is terror. [15] His strong10 scales are his pride,</p>

<p>Shut up together as with a close seal. [16] One is so near to another,</p>

<p>That no air can come between them. [17] They are joined one to another;</p>

<p>They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered. ] His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 19] Out of his mouth go burning torches,</p>

<p>And sparks of fire leap forth. 120] Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth,</p>

<p>As of a boiling pot and burning rushes. 121] His breath kindleth coals,</p>

<p>And a flame goeth forth from his mouth. I22] In his neck abideth strength,</p>

<p>And terror danceth before him. [23] The flakes of his flesh are joined together:</p>

<p>They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. [24] His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.</p>

<p>8 Heb. uncover the face of his garment. 9 Or, His teeth are terrible round about. 10 Or, courses of scales. Heb. channels of shields.</p>

<p>140 JOB</p>

<p>[25] When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid:</p>

<p>By reason of consternation they are beside themselves. [26] If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail;</p>

<p>Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed11 shaft. [27] He counteth iron as straw,</p>

<p>And brass as rotten wood. [28] The arrow12 cannot make him flee:</p>

<p>Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble. [29] Clubs are counted as stubble:</p>

<p>He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin. [30] His underparts are like sharp potsherds:</p>

<p>He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire. [31] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:</p>

<p>He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. [32] He maketh a path to shine after him;</p>

<p>One would think the deep to be hoary. [33] Upon earth there is not his like,</p>

<p>That is made without fear. [34] He beholdeth every thing that is high:</p>

<p>He is king over all the sons of pride.</p>

<p>XLII</p>

<p>[1]    Then Job answered Jehovah, and said, [2] I know that thou canst do all things,</p>

<p>And that no purpose of thine can be restrained. [3] Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?</p>

<p>Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not,</p>

<p>Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. [4] Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak;</p>

<p>I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. [5] I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear;</p>

<p>But now mine eye seeth thee: [6] Wherefore I abhor1 myself,</p>

<p>And repent in dust and ashes.</p>

<p>11 Or, coat of mail.    12 Heb. son of the bow.    1 Or, loathe my words.</p>

<p>JOB I4I</p>

<p>[7] And k was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. [8] Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. [9] So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.</p>

<p>[10] And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before. [11] Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece2 of money, and every one a ring of gold. [12] So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. [13] He had also seven sons and three daughters. [14] And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. [15] And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. [16] And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. [17] So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>

<p>THE BOOK OF PSALMS</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The Book of Psalms is a great collection of the religious lyrics of the Hebrew people. Of unknown authorship, and of uncertain dates, these hymns were gathered and arranged, in part at least, for use in the services of the Temple at Jerusalem; but their profundity of feeling, their simplicity of expression, and the variety of the religious experiences with which they deal have found them a welcome in the hearts of devout people far beyond the limits of Judaism.</p>

<p>The Psalms as they have come down to us are divided into five Books, each ending with a doxology; but it is probable that these divisions are of a later date than the actual collecting of the poems. One hundred of them are attached to individual names; and these names were long supposed to indicate the authors. Thus to David are attributed seventy-three, to Asaph twelve, to Moses one, to Solomon two, to the sons of Koran eleven. These ascriptions are, however, later than the Psalms themselves, and are by no means to be relied on, many of them being demonstrably false. The only poems which are now universally ascribed to David are those in 2 Samuel, I and III; it is doubtful whether he wrote any of the Psalms.</p>

<p>The question of the dates of the Psalms is almost as difficult as that of the authorship. Some have been supposed to be as old as 900 B. C; none is likely to be later than the beginning of the second century B. C; and their composition probably extended over more than five hundred years.</p>

<p>The religious moods to which they give utterance are manifold. Adoration and thanksgiving, prayer and penitence and imprecation, history and prophecy, the general worship of a whole people and the intimate impulses of an individual soulall these and many more are represented in this supreme collection of sacred song.</p>

<p>THE BOOK OF PSALMS</p>

<p>BOOK I I</p>

<p>[i] The Righteous and the Wicked Contrasted</p>

<p>BESSED1 is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers: [2] But his delight is in the law of Jehovah;</p>

<p>And on his law doth he meditate day and night. [3] And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever2 he doeth shall prosper. [4] The wicked are not so,</p>

<p>But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. [5] Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,</p>

<p>Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. [6] For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>The Reign of Jehovah's Anointed</p>

<p>[1] Why do the nations rage,3</p>

<p>And the peoples meditate a vain thing?</p>

<p>[2] The kings of the earth set themselves,</p>

<p>And the rulers take counsel together,</p>

<p>Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,</p>

<p>1 Or, Happy.    2 Or, in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper. 3 Or, tumultuously assemble.</p>

<p>145</p>

<p>I46 PSALMS</p>

<p>[3] Let us break their bonds asunder,</p>

<p>And cast away their cords from us. [4] He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh:</p>

<p>The Lord will have them in derision. [5] Then will he speak unto them in his wrath,</p>

<p>And vex4 them in his sore displeasure: [6] Yet I have set my king</p>

<p>Upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>

<p>[7] I will tell of the decree:</p>

<p>Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son;</p>

<p>This day have I begotten thee. [8] Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance,</p>

<p>And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. [9] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;</p>

<p>Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>

<p>[10] Now therefore be wise, O ye kings:</p>

<p>Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. [11] Serve Jehovah with fear,</p>

<p>And rejoice with trembling. [12] Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way,</p>

<p>For his wrath will5 soon be kindled.</p>

<p>Blessed6 are all they that take refuge in him.</p>

<p>Ill</p>

<p>Morning Prayer op Trust in God A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.</p>

<p>[1] Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased!</p>

<p>Many are they that rise up against me. [2] Many there are that say of1 my soul,</p>

<p>There is no help2 for him in God. [Selah</p>

<p>[3] But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me;</p>

<p>My glory, and the lifter up of my head. [4] I cry unto Jehovah with my voice,</p>

<p>And fie answereth me out of his holy hill. [Selah</p>

<p>* Or, trouble.    5 Or, may.    6 Or, Happy.    1 Or, to.    2 Or, salvation.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>Evening Prayer of Trust in God For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness;</p>

<p>Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress:</p>

<p>Have4 mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. [2] O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor ?</p>

<p>How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?</p>

<p>[Selah</p>

<p>[3] But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him5 that is godly:</p>

<p>Jehovah will hear when I call unto him. [4] Stand6 in awe, and sin not:</p>

<p>Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.</p>

<p>[Selah</p>

<p>[5] Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,</p>

<p>And put your trust in Jehovah. [6] Many there are that say, Who will show us any good?</p>

<p>Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. [7] Thou hast put gladness in my heart,</p>

<p>More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.</p>

<p>3 Or, Victory,    * Or, Be gracious unto me.    5 Or, one that he favoreth. 6 Or, Be ye angry.</p>

<p>[5] I laid me down and slept;</p>

<p>I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me. [6] I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people</p>

<p>That have set themselves against me round about. [7] Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God:</p>

<p>For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone;</p>

<p>Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. [8] Salvation3 belongeth unto Jehovah:</p>

<p>Thy blessing be upon thy people. [Selah</p>

<p>I48 PSALMS</p>

<p>[8] In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;</p>

<p>For thou, Jehovah, alone7 makest me dwell in safety.</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>Prayer for Protection from the Wicked For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth.8 A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] Give ear to my words, O Jehovah,</p>

<p>Consider my meditation. [2] Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God;</p>

<p>For unto thee do I pray. [3] O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice;</p>

<p>In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch.</p>

<p>[4] For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:</p>

<p>Evil9 shall not sojourn with thee. [5] The10 arrogant shall not stand in thy sight:</p>

<p>Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. [6] Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies:</p>

<p>Jehovah abhorreth the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. [7] But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house:</p>

<p>In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. [8] Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine11 enemies:</p>

<p>Make thy way straight12 before my face. [9] For there is no faithfulness13 in their mouth; Their inward part is very14 wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter15 with their tongue. [10] Hold them guilty, O God;</p>

<p>Let them fall by16 their own counsels;</p>

<p>Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions;</p>

<p>For they have rebelled against thee.</p>

<p>7 Or, in solitude.</p>

<p>8 Or, wind instruments. 9 Or, The evil man. 10 Or, Fools. 11 Or, them that lie in wait for me.    12 Or, level.    13 Or, stedfastness.    14 Or, a yawning gulf.</p>

<p>15 Heb. make smooth their tongue.    16 Or, from their counsels.</p>

<p>PSALMS 149</p>

<p>[11] But17 let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice,</p>

<p>Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>

<p>[12] For thou wilt bless the righteous;</p>

<p>O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>Prayer for Mercy in Time of Trouble</p>

<p>For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the1 Sheminith. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger,</p>

<p>Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. [2] Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away:</p>

<p>0 Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled. [3] My soul also is sore troubled:</p>

<p>And thou, O Jehovah, how long? [4] Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul:</p>

<p>Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake. [5] For in death there is no remembrance of thee:</p>

<p>In Sheol who shall give thee thanks? [6] I am weary with my groaning;</p>

<p>Every night make I my bed to swim;</p>

<p>1 water my couch with my tears.</p>

<p>[7] Mine eye wasteth away because of grief;</p>

<p>It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. [8] Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;</p>

<p>For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping. [9] Jehovah hath heard my supplication;</p>

<p>Jehovah will receive my prayer. [10] All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled:</p>

<p>They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.</p>

<p>17 Or, So shall all those . . . rejoice, They shall ever shout . . . and thou shalt defend them: They also . . . shall be joyful in thee. 1 Or, the eighth.</p>

<p>PSALMS</p>

<p>VII</p>

<p>Jehovah Implored to Defend the Psalmist Against the Wicked</p>

<p>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite.</p>

<p>[i] O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge:</p>

<p>Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me, [2] Lest they tear my soul like a lion,</p>

<p>Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. [3] O Jehovah my God, if I have done this;</p>

<p>If there be iniquity in my hands; [4] If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;</p>

<p>(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary);</p>

<p>[5] Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. [Selah</p>

<p>[6] Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger;</p>

<p>Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment. [7] And1 let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about;</p>

<p>And over them return thou on high. [8] Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples:</p>

<p>Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that2 is in me. [9] Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts.3 [10] My shield is with God,</p>

<p>Who saveth the upright in heart. [11] God is a righteous judge,</p>

<p>Yea, a God that hath indignation every day. [12] If4 a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>

<p>1 Or, So shall.    2 Or, be it unto me.    3 Heb. reins. *Or, Surely he will again whet.</p>

<p>PSALMS 151</p>

<p>[13] He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;</p>

<p>He maketh his arrows fiery shafts. [14] Behold, he travaileth with iniquity;</p>

<p>Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. [15] He hath made a pit, and digged it,</p>

<p>And is fallen into the ditch which he made. [16] His mischief shall return upon his own head,</p>

<p>And his violence shall come down upon his own pate. [17] I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness,</p>

<p>And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>Jehovah's Glory and Man's Dignity For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] O Jehovah, our Lord,</p>

<p>How excellent is thy name in all the earth,</p>

<p>Who hast set thy glory upon1 the heavens! [2] Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength,</p>

<p>Because of thine adversaries,</p>

<p>That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. [3] When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,</p>

<p>The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; [4] What is man, that thou art mindful of him?</p>

<p>And the son of man, that thou visitest him ? [5] For thou hast made him but little lower than God,*</p>

<p>And crownest him with glory and honor. [6] Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;</p>

<p>Thou hast put all things under his feet: [7] All sheep and oxen,</p>

<p>Yea, and the beasts of the field, [8] The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,</p>

<p>Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>A Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Justice For the Chief Musician; set to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works. I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most1 High. 3J When mine enemies turn back,</p>

<p>They stumble and perish at thy presence. 4] For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously. Thou hast rebuked the nations,2 thou hast destroyed the wicked;</p>

<p>Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. The3 enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And4 the cities which thou hast overthrown,5 The very remembrance of them is perished. But Jehovah sitteth as king for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment; And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples6 in uprightness. 9 j Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble; [10] And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee;</p>

<p>For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. [11] Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion:</p>

<p>Declare among the people7 his doings. [12] For8 he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them;</p>

<p>He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.9</p>

<p>[13] Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah;</p>

<p>Behold my affliction which 1 suffer of them that hate me,</p>

<p>Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; [14] That I may show forth all thy praise:</p>

<p>In the gates of the daughter of Zion</p>

<p>I will rejoice in thy salvation.10 [15] The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made:</p>

<p>In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. [16] Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment:</p>

<p>The11 wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.</p>

<p>[Higgaion. Selah [17] The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol,</p>

<p>Even all the nations that forget God. [18] For the needy shall not alway be forgotten,</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>A Prayer for the Overthrow of the Wicked</p>

<p>[1] Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah?</p>

<p>Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? [2] In the pride of the wicked the1 poor is2 hotly pursued;</p>

<p>Let3 them be taken in the devices that they have conceived. [3] For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,</p>

<p>And4 the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth5 Jehovah. [4] The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it.</p>

<p>All his thoughts are, There is no God. [5] His ways are firm6 at all times;</p>

<p>Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.</p>

<p>In the secret places doth he murder the innocent;</p>

<p>His eyes are privily set against the helpless.8 [9] He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert;</p>

<p>And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it? [14] Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief11 and spite to1* requite it with thy hand:</p>

<p>The helpless8 committeth himself unto thee;</p>

<p>Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. [15] Break thou the arm of the wicked;</p>

<p>Jehovah a Refuge and Defence For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] In Jehovah do I take refuge:</p>

<p>How say ye to my soul,</p>

<p>Flee as1 a bird to your mountain; [2] For, lo, the wicked bend the bow,</p>

<p>They make ready their arrow upon the string,</p>

<p>That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart; [3] If2 the foundations be destroyed,</p>

<p>What can the righteous do? [4] Jehovah is in his holy temple;</p>

<p>Jehovah, his throne is in heaven;</p>

<p>His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. [5] Jehovah trieth the righteous;</p>

<p>But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. [6] Upon the wicked he will rain snares;</p>

<p>Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p>

<p>XII</p>

<p>God a Helper Against the Treacherous For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith.5 A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth;</p>

<p>For the6 faithful fail from among the children of men. [2] They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor:</p>

<p>With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. [3] Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips,</p>

<p>Having sorrow in my heart all the day ?</p>

<p>Jehovah Praised for Giving Victory and Dominion For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of Jehovah, who1 spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said,</p>

<p>[1] I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.</p>

<p>[2] Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p>

<p>My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge;</p>

<p>My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. [3] I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:</p>

<p>So shall I be saved from mine enemies. [4] The cords of death compassed me,</p>

<p>And the floods of ungodliness2 made me afraid. [5] The cords of Sheol were round about me;</p>

<p>The snares of death came upon me. [6] In my distress I called upon Jehovah,</p>

<p>And cried unto my God:</p>

<p>He heard my voice out of his temple,</p>

<p>And my cry before him came into his ears. [7] Then the earth shook and trembled;</p>

<p>The foundations also of the mountains quaked</p>

<p>And were shaken, because he was wroth. [8] There went up a smoke out3 of his nostrils,</p>

<p>And fire out of his mouth devoured:</p>

<p>Coals were kindled by it. [9] He bowed the heavens also, and came down;</p>

<p>And thick darkness was under his feet. [10] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;</p>

<p>Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind. [11] He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him,</p>

<p>Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p>

<p>9 Or, let me.    1 See 2 S. 22. 1-51.       2 Heb. Belial.   3 Or, in his wrath.</p>

<p>PSALMS l6l</p>

<p>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire. Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire. And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea,4 lightnings manifold, and discomfited them. Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many5 waters. He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</p>

<p>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay. He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me. Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>

<p>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,</p>

<p>And have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>

<p>For all his ordinances were before me,</p>

<p>And I put not away his statutes from me.</p>

<p>I was also perfect with him,</p>

<p>And I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>

<p>Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,</p>

<p>According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect; With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.</p>

<p>Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness. [29] For by thee I run upon6 a troop;</p>

<p>And by my God do I leap over a wall. [30] As for God, his way is perfect:</p>

<p>The word of Jehovah is tried;</p>

<p>He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him. [31] For who is God, save Jehovah?</p>

<p>And who is a rock, besides our God, [32] The God that girdeth me with strength,</p>

<p>And maketh my way perfect? [33] He maketh my feet like hinds' feet:</p>

<p>And setteth me upon my high places. [34] He teacheth my hands to war;</p>

<p>So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. [35] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation;</p>

<p>And thy right hand hath holden me up,</p>

<p>And thy gentleness7 hath made me great. [36] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,</p>

<p>And my feet8 have not slipped. [37] I win pursue mine enemies, and overtake them;</p>

<p>Neither will I turn again till they are consumed. [38] I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise:</p>

<p>They shall fall under my feet. [39] For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:</p>

<p>Thou hast subdued9 under me those that rose up against me. [40] Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,</p>

<p>That I might cut off them that hate me. [41] They cried, but there was none to save;</p>

<p>Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not. [42] Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind;</p>

<p>I did cast10 them out as the mire of the streets. 8 Or, through.</p>

<p>The foreigners shall submit12 themselves unto me. [45] The foreigners shall fade away,</p>

<p>And shall come trembling out of their close places. [46] Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock;</p>

<p>And exalted be the God of my salvation, [47] Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,</p>

<p>And subdueth peoples under me. [48] He rescueth me from mine enemies;</p>

<p>Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;</p>

<p>Thou deliverest me from the violent man. [49] Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,</p>

<p>And will sing praises unto thy name. [50] Great deliverance13 giveth he to his king,</p>

<p>The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether. [10] More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;</p>

<p>Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. [11] Moreover by them is thy servant warned:</p>

<p>In keeping them there is great reward. [12] Who can discern his errors?</p>

<p>Security of those who Trust in Jehovah, and Insecurity of the Wicked</p>

<p>A Psalm of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers,</p>

<p>Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.</p>

<p>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb. Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell1 in the land, and feed2 on his faithfulness. Delight3 thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires4 of thy heart. Commit5 thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass. And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noonday. Rest6 in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. For evil-doers shall be cut off;</p>

<p>But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the7 land. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he8 shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.</p>

<p>1 Or, So shalt thou dwell in the land and feed securely.</p>

<p>2 Or, verily thou shalt be fed. 3 Or, So shalt thou have thy delight in trc. * Heb. petitions.    5 Heb. Roll thy way upon fehovah.</p>

<p>[ 14] The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,</p>

<p>To cast down the poor and needy,</p>

<p>To slay such as are upright in the way. [15] Their sword shall enter into their own heart,</p>

<p>And their bows shall be broken. [16] Better is a little that the righteous hath</p>

<p>Than the abundance of many wicked. [17] For the arms of the wicked shall be broken;</p>

<p>But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous. [18] Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect;</p>

<p>And their inheritance shall be for ever. [19] They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil;</p>

<p>And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. [20] But the wicked shall perish,</p>

<p>And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the9 fat of lambs:</p>

<p>They shall consume; in10 smoke shall they consume away. [21] The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again;</p>

<p>But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth. [22] For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land;</p>

<p>And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off. [23] A man's goings are established of Jehovah;</p>

<p>And he delighteth in his way. [24] Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;</p>

<p>For Jehovah upholdeth11 him with his hand. [25] I have been young, and now am old;</p>

<p>Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,</p>

<p>Nor his seed begging bread. [26] All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth;</p>

<p>And his seed is blessed. [27] Depart from evil, and do good;</p>

<p>And dwell for evermore. [28] For Jehovah loveth justice,</p>

<p>And forsaketh not his saints;</p>

<p>They are preserved for ever:</p>

<p>But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>

<p>None of his steps shall slide. [32] The wicked watcheth the righteous,</p>

<p>And seeketh to slay him. [33] Jehovah will not leave him in his hand,</p>

<p>Nor condemn him when he is judged. [34] Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way,</p>

<p>And he will exalt thee to inherit the land:</p>

<p>When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. [35] I have seen the wicked in great power,</p>

<p>And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. [36] But12 one passed by, and, lo, he was not:</p>

<p>Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. [37] Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright;</p>

<p>For there is a happy end to the man of peace. [38] As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together:</p>

<p>The end of the wicked shall be cut off. [39] But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah:</p>

<p>He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. [40] And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them:</p>

<p>He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them,</p>

<p>Because they have taken refuge in him.</p>

<p>The Vanity of Life For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun.1 A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue:</p>

<p>I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. [3] I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried:</p>

<p>Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. [4] They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:</p>

<p>They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully,2</p>

<p>are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore. [5] O God, thou knowest my foolishness;</p>

<p>And my sins3 are not hid from thee. [6] Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel: [7] Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;</p>

<p>Shame hath covered my face. [8] I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother's children. [9] For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up;</p>

<p>And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.</p>

<p>[10] When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting,</p>

<p>That was to my reproach, [n] When I made sackcloth my clothing,</p>

<p>I became a byword unto them. [12] They that sit in the gate talk of me;</p>

<p>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink:</p>

<p>Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>

<p>Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,</p>

<p>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.</p>

<p>And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily. Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies.</p>

<p>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor:</p>

<p>Mine adversaries are all before thee.</p>

<p>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full4 of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none. They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, let it become a trap. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake. Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them. Let their habitation5 be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.

<p>And with thy honor all the day. [9] Cast me not off in the time of old age;</p>

<p>The End of the Wicked Contrasted with that of the Righteous</p>

<p>A Psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>[1] Surely1 God is good to Israel,</p>

<p>Even to such as are pure in heart. [2] But as for me, my feet were almost gone;</p>

<p>[4] For there are no pangs in their death;</p>

<p>But their strength is firm. [5] They are not in3 trouble as other men;</p>

<p>Neither are they plagued like other men. [6] Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;</p>

<p>Violence covereth them as a garment. [7] Their eyes stand out with fatness:</p>

<p>They4 have more than heart could wish. [8] They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression:</p>

<p>They speak loftily.5 [9] They have set their mouth in6 the heavens,</p>

<p>And their tongue walketh through the earth. [10] Therefore his7 people return hither:</p>

<p>And waters of a full cup are drained by them. [11] And they say, How doth God know?</p>

<p>And is there knowledge in the Most High? [12] Behold, these are the wicked;</p>

<p>And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches. [13] Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,</p>

<p>And washed my hands in innocency; [14] For all the day long have I been plagued,</p>

<p>And chastened8 every morning. [15] If I had said, I will speak thus;</p>

<p>Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.</p>

<p>[16] When I thought how I might know this,</p>

<p>It was too9 painful for me; [17] Until I went into the sanctuary of God,</p>

<p>And considered their latter end. [18] Surely thou settest them in slippery places:</p>

<p>Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance;</p>

<p>They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting</p>

<p>it to the ground. They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues3 of God in the land. We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet;</p>

<p>Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach ? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever ? Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluc\ it out of thy bosom and consume them.</p>

<p>Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth. Thou didst divide4 the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>

<p>Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driest up mighty5 rivers. The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light6 and the sun. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.</p>

The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law; And they forgat his doings,</p>

<p>And his wondrous works that he had showed them. Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap. In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire. He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers. Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the3 desert. And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according4 to their desire. Yea, they spake against God;</p>

<p>And allotted them for an inheritance by line,</p>

<p>And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. [56] Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</p>

<p>And kept not his testimonies; [57] But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:</p>

<p>They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. [58] For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</p>

<p>And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. [59] When God heard this, he was wroth,</p>

<p>And greatly abhorred Israel; [60] So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,</p>

<p>The tent which he placed among men; [61] And delivered his strength into captivity,</p>

<p>And his glory into the adversary's hand. [62] He gave his people over also unto the sword,</p>

<p>And was wroth with his inheritance. [63] Fire devoured their young men;</p>

<p>And their virgins had no marriage-song. [64] Their priests fell by the sword;</p>

<p>And their widows made no lamentation. [65] Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,</p>

<p>Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. [66] And he smote his adversaries backward:</p>

<p>He put them to a perpetual reproach. [67] Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,</p>

<p>And chose not the tribe of Ephraim, [68] But chose the tribe of Judah,</p>

<p>The mount Zion which he loved. [69] And he built his sanctuary like the heights,</p>

<p>And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. [7] For they have devoured Jacob,</p>

<p>And laid waste his habitation.1 [8] Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers:</p>

<p>Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations.</p>

<p>Before the mountains were brought forth,</p>

<p>Or ever thou hadst1 formed the earth and the world,</p>

<p>Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</p>

<p>Thou turnest man to destruction,2</p>

<p>Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:</p>

<p>In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</p>

<p>In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;</p>

<p>In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>

<p>For we are consumed in thine anger,</p>

<p>And in thy wrath are we troubled.</p>

<p>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,</p>

<p>Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</p>

<p>For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:</p>

<p>We bring our years to an end as a4 sigh.</p>

<p>The days of our years are threescore years and ten,</p>

<p>Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;</p>

<p>Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow;</p>

<p>Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: [2] Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment;</p>

<p>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; [3] Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters;</p>

<p>Who maketh the clouds his chariot;</p>

<p>Who walketh upon the wings of the wind; [4] Who maketh winds1 his messengers;</p>

<p>Flames of fire his ministers; [5] Who2 laid the foundations of the earth,</p>

<p>That it should not be moved for ever. [6] Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;</p>

<p>The waters stood above the mountains.</p>

<p>That they turn not again to cover the earth. [10] He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;</p>

<p>They run among the mountains; [11] They give drink to every beast of the field;</p>

<p>The wild asses quench their thirst. [12] By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation;</p>

<p>They sing4 among the branches. [13] He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. [14] He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service5 of man; That he may bring forth food6 out of the earth, [15] And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And1 oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man's heart. [16] The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture;</p>

<p>The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; [17] Where the birds make their nests:</p>

<p>As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. I] The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies. [19] He appointed the moon for seasons:</p>

<p>The sun knoweth his going down. [20] Thou makest darkness, and it is night,</p>

<p>Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. [21] The young lions roar after their prey,</p>

<p>And seek their food from God. [22] The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.</p>

<p>The earth is full of thy riches.8 [25] Yonder is the sea, great and wide,</p>

<p>Wherein are things creeping innumerable,</p>

<p>Both small and great beasts. [26] There go the ships;</p>

<p>There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.9 [27] These wait all for thee,</p>

<p>That thou mayest give them their food in due season. [28] Thou givest unto them, they gather;</p>

<p>Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. [29] Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled;</p>

<p>Thou takest10 away their breath, they die,</p>

<p>And return to their dust. [30] Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created;</p>

<p>And thou renewest the face of the ground. [31] Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever;</p>

<p>Let Jehovah rejoice in his works: [32] Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;</p>

<p>He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. [33] I      s^nS unt0 Jehovah as long as I live:</p>

<p>Joseph was sold for a servant: [18] His feet they hurt with fetters:</p>

<p>The word of Jehovah tried him. [20] The king sent and loosed him;</p>

<p>Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. [21] He made him lord of his house,</p>

<p>And ruler of all his substance; [22] To bind his princes at his pleasure,</p>

<p>And teach his elders wisdom. [23] Israel also came into Egypt;</p>

<p>And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. [24] And he increased his people greatly,</p>

<p>And made them stronger than their adversaries. [25] He turned their heart to hate his people,</p>

<p>To deal subtly with his servants. [26] He sent Moses his servant,</p>

<p>And Aaron whom he had chosen. [27] They set among them his4 signs,</p>

<p>And wonders in the land of Ham. [28] He sent darkness, and made it dark;</p>

<p>And they rebelled not against his words. [29] He turned their waters into blood,</p>

<p>And slew their fish. [30] Their land swarmed with frogs</p>

<p>In the chambers of their kings. [31] He spake, and there came swarms of flies,</p>

<p>And lice in all their borders. [32] He gave them hail for rain,</p>

<p>And flaming fire in their land. [33] He smote their vines also and their fig-trees,</p>

<p>And brake the trees of their borders. [34] He spake, and the locust came,</p>

<p>And the grasshopper, and that without number,</p>

<p>3 Heb. His soul entered into the iron.      * Heb. the words of his signs.</p>

<p>And there was not6 one feeble person among his tribes. [38] Egypt was glad when they departed;</p>

<p>For the fear of them had fallen upon them. [39] He spread a cloud for a covering,</p>

<p>And fire to give light in the night. [40] They asked, and he brought quails,</p>

<p>And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. [41] He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;</p>

<p>They ran in the dry places like a river. [42] For he remembered his holy word,</p>

<p>And Abraham his servant. [43] And he brought forth his people with joy,</p>

<p>And his chosen with singing. [44] And he gave them the lands of the nations;</p>

<p>Oh visit me with thy salvation, [5] That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen,</p>

<p>That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,</p>

<p>That I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>

<p>[6] We have sinned with our fathers,</p>

<p>We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. [7] Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;</p>

<p>They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses,</p>

<p>But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. [8] Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,</p>

<p>That he might make his mighty power to be known. [9] He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:</p>

<p>So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.1 [10] And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,</p>

<p>And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. [11] And the waters covered their adversaries;</p>

<p>There was not one of them left. [12] Then believed they his words;</p>

<p>They sang his praise. [13] They soon forgat his works;</p>

<p>They waited not for his counsel, [14] But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,</p>

<p>And tempted God in the desert. [15] And he gave them their request,</p>

<p>But sent leanness into their soul. [16] They envied Moses also in the camp,</p>

<p>And Aaron the saint2 of Jehovah. [17] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,</p>

<p>And covered the company of Abiram. [18] And a fire was kindled in their company;</p>

<p>Their flame burned up the wicked. [ 19] They made a calf in Horeb,</p>

<p>And worshipped a molten image.</p>

<p>1 Or, pasture land.       2 Or, holy one.</p>

<p>PSALMS 279</p>

<p>[20] Thus they changed their glory</p>

<p>For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. [21] They forgat God their Saviour,</p>

<p>Who had done great things in Egypt, 122] Wondrous works in the land of Ham,</p>

<p>And terrible things by the Red Sea. [23] Therefore he said that he would destroy them,</p>

<p>Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,</p>

<p>To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. [24] Yea, they despised the pleasant land</p>

<p>They believed not his word, [25] But murmured in their tents,</p>

<p>And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. [26] Therefore he sware3 unto them,</p>

<p>That he would overthrow4 them in the wilderness, [27] And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,</p>

<p>And scatter them in the lands. [28] They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,</p>

<p>And ate the sacrifices of the dead. [29] Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;</p>

<p>And the plague brake in upon them. [30] Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;</p>

<p>And so the plague was stayed. [31] And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,</p>

<p>Unto all generations for evermore. [32] They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,5</p>

<p>So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; [33] Because they were rebellious against his spirit,</p>

<p>And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. [34] They did not destroy the peoples,</p>

<p>As Jehovah commanded them, [35] But mingled themselves with the nations,</p>

<p>And learned their works, [36] And served their idols,</p>

<p>Which became a snare unto them. [37] Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</p>

<p>3 Heb. lifted up his hand.    4 Heb. make them fall.    5 Or, strife.</p>

<p>[38] And shed innocent blood,</p>

<p>Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,</p>

<p>Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;</p>

<p>And the land was polluted with blood. [39] Thus were they defiled with their works,</p>

<p>And played the harlot in their doings. [40] Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people,</p>

<p>And he abhorred his inheritance. [41] And he gave them into the hand of the nations;</p>

<p>And they that hated them ruled over them. [42] Their enemies also oppressed them,</p>

<p>And they were brought into subjection under their hand. [43] Many times did he deliver them;</p>

<p>But they were rebellious in their counsel,</p>

<p>And were brought low in their iniquity. [44] Nevertheless he regarded their distress,</p>

<p>When he heard their cry: [45] And he remembered for them his covenant,</p>

<p>And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkind-nesses.</p>

<p>[46] He made them also to be pitied</p>

<p>Of all those that carried them captive.</p>

<p>[47] Save us, O Jehovah our God,</p>

<p>And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.</p>

<p>Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,</p>

<p>Being bound in affliction and iron,</p>

<p>Because they rebelled against the words of God,</p>

<p>And contemned the counsel of the Most High:</p>

<p>And get them fruits of increase. [38] He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;</p>

<p>And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. [39] Again, tnev are diminished and bowed down</p>

<p>O Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; Thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou searchest1 out my path and my lying down, And art acquainted with all my ways.</p>

<p>Or, winnowest.</p>

<p>320 PSALMS</p>

<p>[4] For there is not a word in my tongue,</p>

<p>But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether. [5] Thou hast beset me behind and before,</p>

<p>And laid thy hand upon me. [6] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;</p>

<p>It is high, I cannot attain unto it. [7] Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?</p>

<p>Or whither shall I flee from thy presence ? [8] If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:</p>

<p>If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there. [9] If I take the wings of the morning,</p>

<p>And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; [10] Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me. [n] If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm2 me,</p>

<p>And3 the light about me shall be night; [12] Even the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are both alike to thee. [13] For thou didst form my inward4 parts:</p>

<p>Thou didst cover5 me in my mother's womb. [14] I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well. [15] My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret,</p>

<p>And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. [16] Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance;</p>

<p>And in thy book they were all written,</p>

<p>Even the days that were ordained for me,</p>

<p>When as yet there was none of them. [17] How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!</p>

<p>How great is the sum of them!</p>

<p>2 Or, cover.    3 Or, Then the night shall be light about me.    4 Heb. reins. 5 Or, knit me together.</p>

<p>Prayer for Protection against the Wicked For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p>[1] Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man;</p>

<p>Preserve me from the violent man: [2] Who devise mischiefs in their heart;</p>

<p>Continually do they gather1 themselves together for war. [3] They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;</p>

<p>Adders' poison is under their lips. [Selah</p>

<p>[4] Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked;</p>

<p>Preserve me from the violent man:</p>

<p>Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. [5] The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;</p>

<p>They have spread a net by the wayside;</p>

<p>They have set gins for me. [Selah</p>

<p>[6] I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God:</p>

<p>Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.</p>

<p>6 Or, Oh that thou wouldest slay.    7 Or, utter thy name (Heb. thee).  Or, as otherwise read, rebel against thee.    8 Or, lift themselves up against thee for vanity. 9 Or, do not 1 loathe.    10 Or, way of pain. 1 Or, stir up wars.</p>

<p>[18] If I should count them, they are more in number than 'the sand:</p>

<p>When I awake, I am still with thee. [19] Surely6 thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:</p>

<p>Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men. [20] For they speak7 against thee wickedly,</p>

<p>And thine enemies take8 thy name in vain. [21] Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee?</p>

<p>And am9 not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ? [22] I hate them with perfect hatred:</p>

<p>They are become mine enemies. [23] Search me, O God, and know my heart:</p>

<p>Try me, and know my thoughts; [24] And see if there be any wicked10 way in me,</p>

<p>And lead me in the way everlasting.</p>

<p>322 PSALMS</p>

<p>[7] O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation,</p>

<p>Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. [8] Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked;</p>

<p>Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves.    [Selah [9] As for the head of those that compass me about,</p>

<p>Let the mischief of their own lips cover them. [10] Let burning coals fall upon them:</p>

<p>Let them be cast into the fire,</p>

<p>Into deep2 pits, whence they shall not rise. [11] An3 evil speaker shall not be established in the earth:</p>

<p>Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. [12] I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted,</p>

<p>And justice for the needy. [13] Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:</p>

<p>The upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>

<p>Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee. [2] Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee;</p>

<p>The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.4 [3] Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;</p>

<p>Keep the door of my lips. [4] Incline not my heart to any evil thing,</p>

<p>To practise deeds of wickedness</p>

<p>With men that work iniquity:</p>

<p>And let me not eat of their dainties. [5] Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness;</p>

<p>In thee do I take refuge; leave7 not my soul destitute. [9] Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,</p>

<p>And from the gins of the workers of iniquity. [10] Let the wicked fall into their own nets,</p>

<p>Whilst that I withal escape.3</p>

<p>In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. [2] And enter not into judgment with thy servant;</p>

<p>For in thy sight no man living is righteous. [3] For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;</p>

<p>He hath smitten my life down to the ground:</p>

<p>He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. [4] Therefore is3 my spirit overwhelmed within me;</p>

<p>Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him ? [4] Man is like to vanity:1</p>

<p>Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. [6] Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;</p>

<p>(HEBREW)</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>OR, THE PREACHER</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The Book of Ecclesiastes, in Hebrew, "Koheleth," is now generally regarded by scholars as of late date, perhaps about the third century before Christ. The ascription of the authorship to Solomon in the opening sentence was probably meant merely as a literary device, Solomon being chosen as a pre-eminent type of the man who had had opportunity to test all that life has to offer. Of the actual author nothing is known.</p>

<p>The general spirit of the work is despondent, even pessimistic. The opening sentences strike the keynote; and though the book contains many contradictions, there is no question as to its prevailing tone. Nowhere else in the Old Testament is there such insistence on the futility of human endeavor, such cold-blooded proclaiming of the vanity of the attempts of man to dignify his existence. Yet the book has, as has been said, many inconsistencies; and it closes with an epilogue so different from the general tone and, in some respects, so contrary to it, that the hypothesis of a plurality of authors has naturally been proposed. Even those who interpret the contradictions in the body of the work as expressions of the varying moods of one author, grant, as a rule, that the epilogue (XII, 9-14) is a later addition; while others account for such opposite views as are found, for example in VIII, 12-13 and VIII, 14, as due to the insertion of protests by some more orthodox and pious writer.</p>

<p>However these things are to be explained, the book is one of the great utterances of that mood of despair which the perplexities of life, and the weariness of struggle or satiety, cause to descend at times upon the human spirit in all epochs and under all civilizations. Its religious value has often been debated; there is no question as to its standing as literature.</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>OR, THE PREACHER</p>

<p>[i] I</p>

<p>TIE words of the1 Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. [2] Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity. [3] What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun ? [4] One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever. [5] The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth. [6] The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. [7] All the rivers2 run into the sea, yet the sea is not'full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. [8] All3 things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. [9] That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. [10] Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us. [11] There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after.</p>

<p>[12] I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. [13] And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. [14] I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a4 striving after wind. [15] That which is crooked cannot be made</p>

<p>1 Heb. Koheleth.      2 Or, torrents.      3 Or, All words are feeble.</p>

<p>4 Or, a feeding on wind (see Hos. 12. 1). Or, vexation of spirit (and so elsewhere).</p>

<p>335</p>

<p>336 ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>straight; and that5 which is wanting cannot be numbered. [16] I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above6 all that were before me in7 Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath8 had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. [17] And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. [18] For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>[1] I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore9 enjoy pleasure:10 and, behold, this also was vanity. [2] I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it? [3] I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding11 me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all12 the days of their life. [4] I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; [5] I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; [6] I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared; [7] I bought men-servants and maidservants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; [8] I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical13 instruments, and that of all sorts. [9] So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained14 with me. [10] And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor. [11] Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</p>

<p>[12] And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after15 the king? even that which hath been done long ago. [13] Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. [14] The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all. [15] Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. [16] For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! [17] So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>

<p>[18] And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. [19] And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. [20] Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun. [21] For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness;16 yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave" it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. [22] For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving18 of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? [23] For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.</p>

<p>[24] There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. [25] For who can eat, or who can have19 enjoyment, more20 than I? [26] For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may</p>

<p>15 Or, after the king, even him whom they made king long ago? Or, after the k'ng, in those things which have been already done?</p>

<p>16 Or, success.     17 Heb. give.</p>

<p>18 Or, vexation.     19 Or, hasten thereto.    20 Acc. to Sept. and Syr. apart from him.</p>

<p>33o ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>

<p>Ill</p>

<p>[i] For every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose1 under heaven: [2] a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; [3] a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; [4] a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; [5] a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; [6] a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; [7] a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; [8] a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. [9] What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth? [10] I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. [11] He hath made every thing beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity2 in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. [12] I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to3 do good so long as they live. [13] And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God. [14] I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him. [15] That4 which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed5 away.</p>

<p>[16] And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. [17] I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose6 and for every work. [18] I7 said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts. [19] For that which befalleth 1 Or, matter.    2 Or, the world.    3 Or, to get good.</p>

<p>* Or, That which hath been is now.    5 Heb. driven away.    6 Or, matter. 7 Or, / said in my heart concerning the sons of men. It is that God &c.</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES 339</p>

<p>the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath;8 and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity. [20] All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. [21] Who knoweth the spirit of9 man, whether10 it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether10 it goeth downward to the earth? [22] Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back,t0 see what shall be after him?</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>[1] Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. [2] Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive; [3] yea, better1 than them both did I esteem him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>

<p>[4] Then I saw all labor and every skilful2 work, that for3 this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. [5] The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. [6] Better is a handful, with4 quietness, than two hand-fuls with4 labor and striving after wind.</p>

<p>[7] Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. [8] There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good ? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. [9] Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor. [10] For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. [11] Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? [12] And if a man prevail against</p>

<p>8 Or, spirit.     9 Heb. of the sons of men.      10 Or, that goeth.</p>

<p>1 Or, better than they both is he that &c.</p>

<p>2 Or, successful.    3 Or, it cometh of a man's rivalry with his neighbor.    4 Or, of.</p>

<p>340 ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>

<p>[13] Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. [14] For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor. [15] I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. [16] There5 was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>[1] Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil. [2] Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any6 thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. [3] For a dream cometh with a multitude of business,7 and a fool's voice with a multitude of words. [4] When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest. [5] Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. [6] Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel,8 that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? [7] For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear thou God.</p>

<p>[8] If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a9 province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there are higher than they. [9] Moreover10 the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</p>

<p>[10] He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity. [11] When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what</p>

<p>5 Or, There is no end, in the mind of all the people, to all that hath been before them; they also &c. 6 Or, a word. 7 Or, travail. 8 Or, messenger of God. See Mai. 2. 7. 9 Or, the state. 10 Or, But the profit of a land every way is a king that maketh himself servant to the field (or, is a k'ng over the eultivated field).</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES 341</p>

<p>advantage is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding of them with his eyes? [12] The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</p>

<p>[13] There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt: [14] and those riches perish by evil adventure;2 and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. [15] As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand. [16] And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind? [17] All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore vexed, and hath sickness and wrath.</p>

<p>[18] Behold, that11 which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, wherein he laboreth under the sun, all12 the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion. [19] Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor, this is the gift of God. [20] For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>[1] There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men: [2] a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. [3] If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he: [4] for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness; [5] moreover it hath not seen the</p>

<p>2 Or, travail,    11 Or, that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one Sr. 12 Heb. the number of the days.</p>

<p>342 ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>sun nor1 known it; this2 hath rest rather than the other: [6] yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good, do not all go to one place ?</p>

<p>[7] All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. [8] For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or3 what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living? [9] Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>

<p>[10] Whatsoever4 hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is known what man5 is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he. [11] Seeing there are many things6 that increase vanity, what is man the better? [12] For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all7 the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?</p>

<p>VII</p>

<p>[1] A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of one's birth. [2] It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. [3] Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.8 [4] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>

<p>[5] It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. [6] For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. [7] Surely9 extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.</p>

<p>[8] Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. [9] Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry;10 for anger11 resteth in the bosom of fools. [10] Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days</p>

<p>1 Or, neither had any knowledge.    2 Or, it is better with this than with the other.</p>

<p>3 Or, or the poor man that hath understanding, in walking before the living.</p>

<p>4 Or, Whatsoever he be, his name was given him long ago, and it is k"own that he is man. 5 Heb. Adam. See Gen. 2. 7. 6 Or, words. 7 Heb. the number of the days.</p>

<p>8 Or, better.      9 Or, For.      10 Or, vexed.      11 Or, vexation.</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES 343</p>

<p>were better than these ? for thou dost not inquire wisely12 concerning this.</p>

<p>[n] Wisdom is13 as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun. [12] For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it. [13] Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked ? [14] In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out any thing that shall be after him.</p>

<p>[15] All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing. [16] Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? [17] Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? [18] It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.</p>

<p>[19] Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city. [20] Surely2 there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. [21] Also take14 not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee; [22] for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>

<p>[23] All this have I proved15 in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. [24] That which is,16 is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out? [25] I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that17 wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness. [26] And I find more bitter than death the woman whose18 heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be</p>

<p>12 Heb. out of wisdom. 13 Or, is good together with an inheritance, and profitable unto them &c.    14 Heb. give not thy heart.    15 Or, tried by.    16 Or, hath been.</p>

<p>17 Or, the wickedness of folly, and foolishness which is madness.</p>

<p>18 Or, who is a snare, and her heart is as nets.</p>

<p>344 ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>taken by her. [27] Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher,</p>

<p>laying19 one thing to another, to find out the account; [28] which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a women among all those have I not found. [29] Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>[1] Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness1 of his face is changed. [2] I counsel thee, Keep the king's command, and that in regard of the oath of God. [3] Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. [4] For the king's word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou? [5] Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man's heart discerneth time and judgment: [6] for to every purpose2 there is a time and judgment; because the misery3 of man is great upon him: [7] for he knoweth not that which shall be; for4 who can tell him how it shall be? [8] There is no man that hath power over the spirit5 to retain the spirit;5 neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in6 war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.</p>

<p>[9] All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there1 is a time wherein one man hath power over another to8 his hurt. [10] So I saw the wicked buried, and9 they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity. [11] Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully10 set in them to do evil. [12] Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that</p>

<p>19 Or, weighing one thing ajter another, to find out the reason. 1 Heb. strength.    2 Or, matter.    3 Or, evil.</p>

<p>* Or, for even when it cometh to pass, who shall declare it unto him?</p>

<p>5 Or, wind.    6 Or, in battle.    7 Or, what time one man had Src.</p>

<p>8 Or, to his own hurt. 9 Or, who had come and gone away from the holy place; and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. Or, and men came and went fc.     10 Or, emboldened.</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES 345</p>

<p>fear God, that fear before him: [13] but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>

<p>[14] There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. [15] Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for11 that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.</p>

<p>[16] When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business12 that is done upon the earth, (for13 also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes), [17] then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>[1] For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.</p>

<p>[2] All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. [3] This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one even unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. [4] For1 to him that is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. [5] For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither</p>

<p>11 Or, and that this should accompany him.    12 Or, travail. 13 Or, how that neither by day nor by night do men see sleep with their eyes. 1 Another reading is, For who is exempted?  With all be, or, who can choose? With all be.</p>

<p>346 ECCLESIASTES</p>

<p>have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. [6] As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>

<p>[7] Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works. [8] Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack oil. [9] Live2 joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun. [10] Whatsoever thy hand findeth3 to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.</p>

<p>[11] I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. [12] For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>

<p>[13] I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me: [14] There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: [15] Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. [16] Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</p>

<p>[17] The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. [18] Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good.</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>[1] Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to4 send forth an evil odor; so doth a little folly outweigh5 wisdom and honor. [2] A wise</p>

<p>2 Or, Enjoy (Heb. See) life.    3 Or, attaineth to do by thy strength, that do. 4 Or, to stin/( and putrefy.    5 Or, him that is valued for wisdom.</p>

<p>ECCLESIASTES 347</p>

<p>man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. [3] Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding6 faileth him, and he saith to7 every one that he is a fool. [4] If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness8 allayeth great offences.</p>

<p>[5] There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler: [6] folly is set in great dignity,9 and the rich sit in a low place. [7] I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.</p>

<p>[8] He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him. [9] Whoso heweth10 out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. [10] If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. [11] If11 the serpent bite before12 it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the13 charmer.</p>

<p>[12] The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. [13] The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his14 talk is mischievous madness. [14] A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him? [15] The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>

<p>[16] Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child,15 and thy princes eat in the morning! [17] Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the16 son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! [18] By slothfulness the roof17 sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. [19] A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things. [20] Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bed-chamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>

<p>[i] Cast1 thy bread upon2 the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days. [2] Give3 a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. [3] If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward4 the south, or toward4 the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be. [4] He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. [5] As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind,5 nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all. [6] In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. [7] Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. [8] Yea,6 if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but7 let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</p>

<p>[9] Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

<p>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The "Gospel according to Luke" was probably written not far from the year 70 A. D. It is quoted in the first half of the second century, and in a fragment dated about 175 A. D. we find the earliest extant ascription of the authorship to Luke. The third Gospel, says the so-called "Canon of Muratori," "Luke compiled in his own name from report, the physician whom Paul took with him after the ascension of Christ, as it were, for a traveling companion; however he did not himself see the Lord in the flesh, and hence begins his account with the birth of John." Eusebius states that Luke was born at Antioch, and Paul seems to imply that he was a Gentile.</p>

<p>The sources from which the compilation was made are still a matter of dispute. Much of the narrative of events seems to be drawn from "Mark"; of the speeches, from that collection of the discourses of Christ which is supposed by scholars to lie behind the gospel of "Matthew." But the author of "Luke" had peculiar sources not used by the other evangelists; and from these come some of the most precious contents of this gospel.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion on the question as to the existence in "Luke" of a Jewish or of a Gentile bias. Those who find it markedly Jewish in tone incline to distrust the tradition ascribing its composition to the Gentile physician; those who regard it as the Pauline gospel naturally find it easier to associate it with the companion of the apostle to the Gentiles. The question is closely connected with the authorship of "The Acts of the Apostles," a continuation of "Luke" by the same hand, which is generally admitted to contain descriptions of Paul's travels recorded by his companion.</p>

<p>The author, whether Luke or another, opens by stating his purpose to be to trace accurately and in order "those matters which have been fulfilled among us." It would be an impertinence to comment on the importance to mankind of the carrying out of his purpose.</p>

<p>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE</p>

<p>FORASMUCH as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled1 among us, [2] even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, [3] it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus; [4] that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things2 wherein3 thou wast instructed.</p>

<p>[5] There was in the days of Herod, king of Judasa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. [6] And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. [7] And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well4 stricken in years.</p>

<p>[8] Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, [9] according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple5 of the Lord and burn incense. [10] And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense. [11] And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. [ 12] And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. [13] But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. [14] And</p>

<p>354 LUKE</p>

<p>thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. [15] For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong6 drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. [16] And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God. [17] And he shall go7 before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to wal\ in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him. [18] And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man, and my wife well8 stricken in years. [19] And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. [20] And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. [21] And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while9 he tarried in the temple.5 [22] And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple :5 and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb. [23] And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.</p>

<p>[24] And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, [25] Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.</p>

<p>[26] Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, [27] to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. [28] And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly10 favored, the Lord is with thee.11 [29] But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. [30] And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor12 with God.</p>

<p>[31] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. [32] He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: [33] and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for13 ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. [34] And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? [35] And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the14 holy thing which is begotten15 shall be called the Son of God. [36] And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was16 called barren. [37] For no word from God shall be void of power. [38] And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid17 of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>

<p>[39] And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah; [40] and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth. [41] And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; [42] and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. [43] And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me? [44] For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. [45] And blessed is she that believed;18 for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord. [46] And Mary said,</p>

<p>My soul doth magnify the Lord, [47] And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. [48] For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid:17 For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p>

<p>356 LUKE</p>

<p>[50] And his mercy is unto generations and generations</p>

<p>On them that fear him. [51] He hath showed strength with his arm;</p>

<p>He hath scattered the proud in19 the imagination of their heart. [52] He hath put down princes from their thrones,</p>

<p>And hath exalted them of low degree. [53] The hungry he hath filled with good things;</p>

<p>And the rich he hath sent empty away. [54] He hath given help to Israel his servant,</p>

<p>That he might remember mercy [55] (As he spake unto our fathers)</p>

<p>Toward Abraham and his seed for ever. [56] And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.</p>

<p>[57] Now Elisabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. [58] And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her. [59] And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. [60] And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. [61] And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. [62] And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called. [63] And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. [64] And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, blessing God. [65] And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. [66] And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>

<p>[67] And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</p>

<p>[68] Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;</p>

<p>For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people, [69] And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us</p>

<p>19 Or, by.</p>

<p>luke 357</p>

<p>In the house of his servant David [70] (As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),</p>

<p>[71] Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</p>

<p>[72] To show mercy towards our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant; [73] The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father, [74] To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear, [75] In holiness and righteousness before him all our days. [76] Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High:</p>

<p>For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;</p>

<p>[77] To give knowledge of salvation unto his people</p>

<p>In the remission of their sins, [78] Because of the tender20 mercy of our God,</p>

<p>Whereby21 the dayspring from on high shall22 visit us, [79] To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death;</p>

<p>To guide our feet into the way of peace. [80] And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>[1] Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the1 world should be enrolled. [2] This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; [5] to enrol himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with</p>

<p>child. [6] And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered. [7] And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</p>

<p>[8] And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch2 by night over their flock. [9] And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. [10] And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people: [11] for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ3 the Lord. [12] And this is the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger. [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, [14] Glory to God in the highest,</p>

<p>And on earth peace4 among men5 in whom he is well pleased. [15] And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing6 that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. [16] And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child. [18] And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds. [19] But Mary kept all these sayings,7 pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.</p>

<p>[21] And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>

<p>[22] And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present</p>

[25] And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him. [26] And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. [27] And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law, [28] then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p>

<p>[29] Now lettest thou thy servant8 depart, Lord,9</p>

<p>According to thy word, in peace; [30] For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, [31] Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; [32] A light for revelation10 to the Gentiles,</p>

<p>And the glory of thy people Israel. [33] And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him; [34] and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against; [35] yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. [36] And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of11 a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, [37] and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day. [38] And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. [39] And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</p>

[46] And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers,13 both hearing them, and asking them questions: [47] and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. [48] And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son,14 why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing. [49] And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in15 my Father's house? [50] And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. [51] And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all these sayings16 in her heart.</p>

[8] Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance,1 and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. [9] And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. [10J And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do? [11] And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise. [12] And there came also publicans2 to be baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do? [13] And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you. [14] And soldiers3 also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse any one wrongfully; and be content with your wages.</p>

<p>[15] And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ; [16] John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy'1 to unloose: he shall baptize you in5 the Holy Spirit and in fire: [17] whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.</p>

<p>[14] And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about. [15] And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</p>

<p>[16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read. [17] And there was delivered unto him the6 book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book,7 and found the place where it was written, [18] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</p>

<p>Because8 he anointed me to preach good9 tidings to the poor: He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives,</p>

<p>To set at liberty them that are bruised, [19] To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. [20] And he closed the book,10 and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. [21] And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears. [22] And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph's son? [23] And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country. [24] And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. [25] But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land; [26] and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath,11 in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. [27] And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. [28] And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things; [29] and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. [30] But he passing through the midst of them went his way.</p>

<p>[31] And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day: [32] and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority. [33] And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, [34] Ah!12 what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene ? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. [35] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt. [36] And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, 10 Or, roll.      11 Gr. Sarepta.    12 Or, Let alone.</p>

<p>saying, What is this13 word? for with authority and power he com-mandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. [37] And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.</p>

<p>[38] And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her. [39] And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.</p>

<p>[40] And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. [41] And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>

<p>[42] And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them. [43] But he said unto them, I must preach the9 good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.</p>

<p>[44] And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.14</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>[1] Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; [2] and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets. [3] And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat. [4] And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. [5] And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets. [6] And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking; [7] and they beckoned unto</p>

<p>their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. [8] But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. [9] For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken; [10] and so were also James1 and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch2 men. [11] And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.</p>

<p>[12] And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. [13] And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him. [14] And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. [15] But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. [16] But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.</p>

<p>[17] And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judza and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to3 heal. [18] And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him. [19] And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus. [20] And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. [21] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? [22] But Jesus perceiving their reasonings,4 answered and said unto them, Why5 reason ye in your hearts? [23] Which is easier, to say, Thy</p>

[24] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house. [25] And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. [26] And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.</p>

<p>[27] And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican,6 named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me. [28J And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.</p>

<p>[29] And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans6 and of others that were sitting at meat with them. [30] And the7 Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans6 and sinners? [31] And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in8 health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick. [32] I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>[33] And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink. [34] And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons9 of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? [35] But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days. [36] And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old. [37] And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins;10 else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish. [38] But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins. [39] And no man. having drunk old wine desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.11</p>

<p>[i] Now it came to pass on a sabbath,1 that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. [2J But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day? [3] And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him; [4] how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show-bread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone? [5] And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.</p>

<p>[6] And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered. [7] And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him. [8] But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. [9] And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it? [10] And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored. [11] But they were filled with madness;2 and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</p>

<p>[12] And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God. [13] And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles: [14] Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James3 and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, [15] and Matthew and Thomas, and James3 the son of Alphseus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, [16] and Judas the son* of James,3 and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor; [17] and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of</p>

<p>the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; [18J and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed. [19] And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed them all.</p>

<p>[20] And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. [21] Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. [22] Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. [23] Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets. [24] But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. [25] Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. [26] Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.</p>

<p>[27] But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, [28] bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you. [29] To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also. [30] Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. [31] And as ye. would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. [32] And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them. [33] And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same. [34] And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much. [35] But love your enemies, and do them good, and lend, never5 despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. [36] Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful. [37] And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall</p>

<p>5 Some ancient authorities read despairing of no man.</p>

<p>370 LUKE</p>

<p>be released: [38] give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.</p>

<p>[39] And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit? [40] The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher. [41 ] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? [42] Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. [43] For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit. [44] For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. [45] The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</p>

<p>[46] And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? [47] Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like: [48] he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because6 it had been well builded. [49] But he that heareth,7 and doeth8 not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.</p>

<p>[2] And a certain centurion's servant,1 who was dear2 unto him, was sick and at the point of death. [3] And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.1 [4] And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him; [5] for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue. [6] And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy3 that thou shouldest come under my roof: [7] wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the4 word, and my servant5 shall be healed. [8] For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant,6 Do this, and he doeth it. [9] And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. [10] And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant6 whole.</p>

<p>[11] And it came to pass soon7 afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. [12] Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. [13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. [14] And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. [15] And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. [16] And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.

[22] And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good10 tidings preached to them. [23] And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.</p>

<p>[24] And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? [25] But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. [26] But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. [27] This is he of whom it is written,</p>

<p>Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>

<p>[28] I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but11 little in the kingdom of God is greater than he. [29] And all the people when they heard, and the publicans,12 justified God, being13 baptized with the baptism of John.

[37] And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting18 at meat in the Pharisee's house, she brought an19 alabaster cruse of ointment, [38] and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed20 his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. [39] Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a21 prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner. [40] And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on. [41] A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings,22 and the other fifty. [42] When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most? [43] Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. [44] And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. [45] Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss23 my feet. [46] My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. [47] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. [48] And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. [49] And they that sat24 at meat with him began to say within25 themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? [50] And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>

<p>[i] And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good1 tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve, [2] and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, [3] and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them2 of their substance.</p>

<p>[4] And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable: [5] The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it. [6] And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. [7] And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. [8] And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>[9] And his disciples asked him what this parable might be. [10] And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. [11] Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. [12] And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. [13] And those on the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. [14] And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. [15] And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.3</p>

<p>[16] And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they 1 Or, gospel.    2 Many ancient authorities read him.      3 Or, stedjastness.</p>

<p>[19] And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd. [20] And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. [21] But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.</p>

<p>[22] Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. [23] But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy. [24] And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. [25] And he said unto them, Where is your faith ? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he com-mandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him ?</p>

<p>[26] And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes,5 which is over against Galilee. [27] And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in any house, but in the tombs. [28] And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not. [29] For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes6 it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts. [30] And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him. [31] And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into</p>

[33] And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned. [34] And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. [35] And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid. [36] And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made7 whole. [37] And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned. [38] But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying, [39] Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.</p>

<p>[40] And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him. [41 ] And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him to come into his house; [42] for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.</p>

<p>[43] And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had8 spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any, [44] came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched. [45] And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me ? And when all denied, Peter said, and9 they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush thee. [46] But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me. [47] And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what</p>

<p>[49] While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher. [50] But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made11 whole. [51] And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother. [52] And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth. [53] And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. [54] But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise. [55] And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that something be given her to eat. [56] And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.</p>

<p>[ 1 ] And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. [2] And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the1 sick. [3] And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats. [4] And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart. [5] And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them. [6] And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel,2 and healing everywhere.</p>

<p>[7] Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead; [8] and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. [9] And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things ? And he sought to see him.</p>

<p>[10] And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida. [n] But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured. [12] And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place. [13] But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people. [14] For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit3 down in companies, about fifty each. [15] And they did so, and made them all sit3 down. [16] And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. [17] And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.</p>

<p>[18] And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am? [19] And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again. [20] And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am ? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God. [21] But he charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no man; [22] saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. [23] And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. [24] For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. [25] For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self? [26] For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels. [27] But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand</p>

<p>[28] And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. [29] And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling. [30] And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah; [31J who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease4 which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. [32] Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when5 they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. [33] And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;6 one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said. [34] And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. [35] And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my7 Son, my chosen: hear ye him. [36] And when the voice came,8 Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.</p>

<p>[37] And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. [38j And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child: [39] and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth9 him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely. [40] And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not. [41] And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son. [42] And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed10 him down, and tare11 him grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. [43] And they were all astonished at the majesty of God.</p>

<p>But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples, [44] Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered12 up into the hands of men. [45] But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</p>

<p>[46] And there arose a reasoning13 among them, which of them was the greatest.14 [47] But when Jesus saw the reasoning13 of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side, [48] and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name re-ceiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least15 among you all, the same is great.</p>

<p>[49] And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he folioweth not with us. [50] But Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he chat is not against you is for you.</p>

<p>[51] And it came to pass, when the days were16 well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, and sent messengers before his face: [52] and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. [53] And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem. [54] And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?17 [55] But he turned, and rebuked them.18 [56] And they went to another village.</p>

<p>[57] And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. [58] And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests;19 but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. [59] And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. [60] But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the</p>

<p>[1] Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others,1 and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come. [2] And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest. [3] Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. [4] Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way. [5] And into whatsoever house ye shall enter,2 first say, Peace be to this house. [6] And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him:3 but if not, it shall turn to you again. [7] And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. [8] And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: [9] and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. [10] But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, [11] Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh. [12] I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. [13] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty4 works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. [14] But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you. [15] And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades. [16] He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me re-jecteth him that sent me.</p>

<p>[17] And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name. [18] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven. [19] Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you. [20] Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.</p>

<p>[21] In that same hour he rejoiced in5 the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank6 thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for7 so it was well-pleasing in thy sight. [22] All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him. [23] And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: [24] for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.</p>

<p>[25] And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? [26] And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? [27] And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with8 all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. [28] And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. [29] But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? [30] Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. [31] And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. [32] And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. [33] But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, [34] and came to him, and bound up his</p>

<p>wounds, pouring on them oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. [35] And on the morrow he took out two shillings,9 and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee. [36] Which of these three, thinkestthou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? [37] And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p>

<p>[38] Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. [39] And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word. [40] But Martha was cumbered10 about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. [41] But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha,11 Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: [42] but12 one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</p>

<p>[1] And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.

<p>[14] And he was casting out a demon that was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled. [15] But some of them said, By7 Beelzebub8 the prince of the demons casteth he out demons. [16] And others, trying him, sought of him a sign from heaven. [17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and9 a house divided against a house falleth. [18] And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out demons by7 Beelzebub.8 [19] And if I by7 Beelzebub8 cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges. [20] But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.

<p>[29] And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah. [30] For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a12 greater than Solomon is here.

<p>[45] And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also.

[47] Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. [48] So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build their tombs.

[6] Are not five sparrows sold for two pence ? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God. [7] But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows. [8] And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me5 before men, him6 shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: [9] but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God. [10] And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphe-meth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. [11] And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: [12] for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.</p>

<p>[13] And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. [14] But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you ? [15] And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for7 a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. [16] And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: [17] and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits? [18] And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods. [19] And I will say to my soul,8 Soul,8 thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. [20] But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is9 thy soul8 required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be ?

<p>[22] And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life,10 what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. [23 j For the life10 is more than the food, and the body than the raiment. [24] Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds! [25] And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the11 measure of his life? [26] If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest? [27] Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [28] But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more shall he clothe you, O ye of little faith? [29] And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. [30] For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. [31] Yet seek ye his12 kingdom, and these things shall be added unto you. [32] Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. [33] Sell that which ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth de-stroyeth. [34] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>

<p>[35] Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; [36] and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him. [37] Blessed are those servants,13 whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them. [38] And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

[42] And the Lord said, Who then is the16 faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season? [43] Blessed is that servant,17 whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. [44] Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath. [45] But if that servant17 shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; [46] the lord of that servant17 shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut18 him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful. [47] And that servant,17 who knew his lord's will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; [48] but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.</p>

<p>[1] Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galikeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. [2] And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these things? [3] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish.

<p>[6] And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard: and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. [7] And he said unto the vine-dresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground? [8] And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: [9] and if it bear fruit thenceforth, well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.</p>

<p>[10] And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day. [11] And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up. [12] And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. [13] And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. [14] And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved</p>

<p>with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath. [15] But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall,2 and lead him away to watering? [16] And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, these eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath? [17] And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p>

<p>[18] He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it? [19] It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof.</p>

<p>[20] And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? [21] It is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures3 of meal, till it was all leavened.</p>

<p>[22] And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem. [23] And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved? And he said unto them, [24] Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.4 [25] When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are; [26] then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets; [27] and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. [28] There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.

<p>[31] In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee. [32] And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am6 perfected. [33] Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. [34] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings, and ye would not! [35] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>[1] And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him. [2] And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy. [3] And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not? [4] But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go. [5] And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an1 ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day? [6] And they could not answer again unto these things.</p>

<p>[7] And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them, [8] When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit2 not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him, [9] and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. [10] But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that</p>

<p>hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit3 at meat with thee, [n] For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

<p>[12] And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. [13] But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: [14] and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.</p>

<p>[15] And when one of them that sat4 at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. [16] But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many: [17] and he sent forth his servant5 at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. [18] And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray thee have me excused. [19] And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused. [20] And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. [21] And the servant5 came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant,5 Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame. [22] And the servant5 said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room. [23] And the lord said unto the servant,5 Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain them to come in, that my house may be filled. [24] For I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.</p>

<p>[25] Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them, [26] If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren,</p>

[29] Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him, [30] saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. [31] Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? [32] Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.

<p>[n] And he said, A certain man had two sons: [12] and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of thy3 substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. [13] And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living. [14] And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. [15] And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. [16] And he would fain have4 filled his belly with the5 husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. [17] But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! [18] I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: [19] I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. [20] And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed6 him. [21] And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.7 [22] But the father said to his servants,8 Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: [23] and bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry: [24] for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. [25] Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.

[29] But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: [30] but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf. [31] And he said unto him, Son,9 thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.

<p>[1] And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods. [2] And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee ? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward. [3] And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed. [4] I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. [5] And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? [6] And he said, A hundred measures' of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond,2 and sit down quickly and write fifty. [7] Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures3 of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond,2 and write fourscore. [8] And his lord commended the4 unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world5 are for their own generations wiser than the sons of the light.

[12] And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your7 own? [13] No servant8 can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>

<p>[14] And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him. [15] And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. [16] The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel9 of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. [17] But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.</p>

<p>[18] Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.</p>

<p>[19] Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring10 sumptuously every day: [20] and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, [21] and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores. [22] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried. [23] And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. [24] And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame. [25] But Abraham said, Son,11 remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now</p>

[27] And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house; [28] for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. [29] But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. [30] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. [31] And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.</p>

<p>[1] And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through whom they come! [2] It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. [3] Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. [4] And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</p>

<p>[5] And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. [6] And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you. [7] But who is there of you, having a servant1 plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat; [8] and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

[12] And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off: [13] and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. [14] And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed. [15] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God; [16] and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. [17] And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine? [18] Were5 there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?6 [19] And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made7 thee whole.</p>

<p>[20] And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: [21] neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within8 you.</p>

<p>[22] And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. [23] And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after them: [24] for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in9 his day. [25] But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation. [26] And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. [27] They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. [28] Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; [29] but in the day that Lot went out from</p>

<p>Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: [30] after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed. [31] In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back. [32] Remember Lot's wife. [33] Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve10 it. [34] I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. [35] There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.11 [37] And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body is, thither will the eagles12 also be gathered together.</p>

<p>[1] And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint; [2] saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man: [3] and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge1 me of mine adversary. [4] And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; [5] yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest2 she wear3 me out by her continual coming. [6] And the Lord said, Hear what the4 unrighteous judge saith. [7] And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and5 yet he is longsuffering over them ? [8] I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith6 on the earth ?</p>

<p>[9] And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all7 others at nought: [10] Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,</p>

<p>and the other a publican.8 [11] The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.8 [12] I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get. [13] But the publican,8 standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying God, be9 thou merciful to me a10 sinner. [14] I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exaketh himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

<p>[15] And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. [16] But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to11 such belongeth the kingdom of God. [17] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.</p>

<p>[18] And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? [19] And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, even God. [20] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother. [21] And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up. [22] And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. [23] But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich. [24] And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! [25] For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. [26] And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved? [27] But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. [28] And Peter said, Lo, we have left our12 own, and followed thee. [29] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto</p>

<p>[31] And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man. [32] For he shall be delivered14 up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon: [33] and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. [34] And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.</p>

<p>[35] And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: [36] and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant. [37] And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. [38] And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. [39] And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. [40] And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, [41] What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. [42] And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made15 thee whole. [43] And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw k, gave praise unto God.</p>

<p>[1] And he entered and was passing through Jericho. [2] And behold, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. [3] And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature. [4] And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. [5] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house. [6] And he made 18 Or, age.    14 Or, betrayed.      15 Or, saved thee.</p>

<p>LUKE 403</p>

<p>haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. [7] And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner. [8] And Zacchseus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold. [9] And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. [10] For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>

<p>[11] And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear. [12] He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. [13] And he called ten servants1 of his, and gave them ten pounds,2 and said unto them, Trade ye herewith till I come. [14] But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us. [15] And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants,1 unto whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading. [16] And the first came before him, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more. [17] And he said unto him, Well done, thou good servant:3 because thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. [18] And the second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds. [19] And he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities. [20] And another4 came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin: [21] for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that which thou didst not sow. [22] He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant.3 Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow; [23] then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I5 at my coming should have required it with interest? [24] And he said</p>

<p>404 LUKE</p>

<p>unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds. [25] And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds. [26] I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him. [27] But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</p>

<p>[28] And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>[29] And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, [30] saying, Go your way into the village over against you; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him. [31] And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him. [32] And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them. [33] And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? [34] And they said, The Lord hath need of him. [35] And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon. [36] And as he went, they spread their garments in the way. [37] And as he was now drawing nigh, even at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty6 works which they had seen; [38] saying, Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. [39] And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples. [40] And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</p>

<p>[41] And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it, [42] saying, If7 thou hadst known in this8 day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace!9 but now they are hid from thine eyes. [43] For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank10 about thee, and compass thee round, and keep</p>

<p>[45] And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold, [46] saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.</p>

<p>[47] And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him: [48] and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.</p>

<p>XX</p>

<p>[1] And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel,1 there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders; [2] and they spake, saying unto him, Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? [3] And he answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a question;2 and tell me: [4] The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? [5] And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him? [6] But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. [7] And they answered, that they knew not whence it was. [8] And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>

<p>[9] And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time. [10] And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant,3 that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. [11] And he sent yet another servant:3 and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty. [12] And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth. [13] And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him. [14] But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one</p>

<p>'Or, good tidings: comp. ch. 3. 18.    2 Gr. word.     3 Gr. bondservant.</p>

<p>406 LUKE</p>

<p>with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. [15] And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them? [16] He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God4 forbid. [17] But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written,</p>

<p>The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner?</p>

<p>[18] Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.</p>

<p>[19] And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them. [20] And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule5 and to the authority of the governor. [21] And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person of any, but of a truth teachest the way of God: [22] Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? [23] But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, [24] Show me a denarius.6 Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar's. [25] And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. [26] And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</p>

<p>[27] And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection; [28] and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man's brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. [29] There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless; [30] and the second; [31] and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died. [32] Afterward the woman also</p>

<p>4 Gr. Be it not so.    5 Or, ruling power.     6 See marginal note on ch. 7. 41.</p>

<p>LUKE 407</p>

<p>died. [33] In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife. [34] And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world7 marry, and are given in marriage: [35] but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world,7 and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: [36] for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. [37] But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. [38] Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. [39] And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said. [40] For they durst not any more ask him any question.</p>

<p>[41] And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David's son? [42] For David himself saith in the book of Psalms,</p>

<p>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>

<p>[43] Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.</p>

<p>[44] David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?</p>

<p>[45] And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples, [46 J Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the market-places, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts; [47] who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.</p>

<p>[1] And he looked up, and1 saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury. [2] And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. [3] And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all: [4] for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had.</p>

<p>[5] And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said, [6] As for these things which ye</p>

<p>1 Or, age.    1 Or, and saw them that . . . treasury, and they were rich.</p>

<p>40-8 LUKE</p>

<p>behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. [7] And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when these things are about to come to pass? [8] And he said, Take heed that ye be not led astray: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am he; and, The time is at hand: go ye not after them. [9] And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to pass first; but the end is not immediately.</p>

<p>[10] Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; [n] and there shall be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven. [12] But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing2 you before kings and governors for my name's sake. [13] It shall turn out unto you for a testimony. [14] Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer: [15] for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay. [16] But ye shall be delivered3 up even by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and some of you shall4 they cause to be put to death. [17] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake. [18] And not a hair of your head shall perish. [19] In your patience5 ye shall win your souls.8</p>

<p>[20] But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. [21] Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein. [22] For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. [23] Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land,7 and wrath unto this people. [24] And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>

<p>[25] And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows; [26] men fainting8 for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world9: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. [27] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. [28] But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.</p>

<p>[29] And he spake to them a parable: Behold the fig tree, and all the trees: [30] when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh. [31] Even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh. [32] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished. [33] Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</p>

<p>[34] But take heed to yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a snare: [35] for so shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth. [36] But watch ye at every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>

<p>[37] And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet. [38] And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</p>

<p>XXII</p>

<p>[1] Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. [2] And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people.</p>

<p>[3] And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. [4] And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver1 him unto them. [5] And they were glad, and covenanted to give</p>

<p>8 Or, expiring.    9 Gr. the inhabited earth. 1 Or, betray.</p>

<p>410 LUKE</p>

<p>him money. [6] And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver1 him unto them in2 the absence of the multitude.</p>

<p>[7] And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed. [8] And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat. [9] And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready? [10] And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth. [11] And ye shall say unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? [12] And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. [13] And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>

<p>[14] And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him. [15] And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: [16] for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. [17] And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: [18] for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. [19] And he took bread,3 and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which4 is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. [20] And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, even that which is poured out for you. [21] But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth5 me is with me on the table. [22] For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed!5 [23] And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>

<p>[24] And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.6 [25] And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors. [26] But ye shall</p>

[27] For which is greater, he that sitteth7 at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth7 at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth. [28] But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations; [29] and Is appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me, [30] that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>[31] Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked9 to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: [32] but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren. [33] And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death. [34] And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>

<p>[35] And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing. [36] And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and10 he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. [37] For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.11 [38] And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</p>

<p>[39] And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him. [40] And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. [41] And he was parted from them about a stone's cast; and he kneeled down and prayed, [42] saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. [43] And12 there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. [44] And being in an agony he prayed</p>

<p>more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. [45] And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, [46] and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</p>

<p>[47] While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. [48] But Jesus said unto him, Judas, be-trayest5 thou the Son of man with a kiss? [49] And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? [50] And a certain one of them smote the servant13 of the high priest, and struck off his right ear. [51] But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. [52] And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves ? [53] When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>

<p>[54] And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off. [55] And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them. [56] And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looking sted-fastly upon him, said, This man also was with him. [57] But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not. [58] And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. [59] And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galikcan. [60] But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. [61] And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day, thou shalt deny me thrice. [62] And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>[63] And the men that held ]esusn mocked him, and beat him. [64] And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: 18 Gr. bondservant.    14 Gr. him.</p>

<p>who is he that struck thee? [65] And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.</p>

<p>[66] And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying, [67] If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: [68] and if I ask you, ye will not answer. [69] But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God. [70] And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye15 say that I am. [71] And they said, What further need have we of witness ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</p>

<p>[1] And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate. [2] And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king. [3] And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest. [4] And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man. [5] But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place. [6] But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. [7] And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.</p>

<p>[8] Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle1 done by him. [9] And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing. [10] And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. [11] And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate. [12] And Herod and Pilate became friends with each</p>

<p>other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>

<p>[13] And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, [14] and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: [15] no, nor yet Herod: for he2 sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. [16] I will therefore chastise him, and release him.3 [18] But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:[19] one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison. [20] And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus; [21] but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him. [22] And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him. [23] But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. [24] And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done. [25] And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</p>

<p>[26] And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.</p>

<p>[27] And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. [28] But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. [29] For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck. [30] Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. [31] For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry ?</p>

<p>[32] And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>

<p>[33] And when they came unto the place which is called The skull,4 there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left. [34] And5 Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots. [35] And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen. [36] And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar, [37] and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself. [38] And there was also a superscription over him, This is the King of the Jews.</p>

<p>[39] And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us. [40] But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. [42] And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in6 thy kingdom. [43] And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</p>

<p>[44] And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land7 until the ninth hour, [45] the sun's8 light failing: and the veil of the temple9 was rent in the midst. [46] And10 Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost. [47] And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. [48] And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts. [49] And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.</p>

<p>[50] And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man [51] (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), a man of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God: [52] this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. [53] And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain. [54] And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew11 on. [55] And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid. [56] And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.</p>

<p>And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</p>

<p>[i] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. [2] And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. [3] And they entered in, and found not the body of1 the Lord Jesus. [4] And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel: [5] and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the2 living among the dead? [6] He3 is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, [7] saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. [8] And they remembered his words, [9] and returned from4 the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. [10] Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.</p>

<p>[13] And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem. [14] And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened. [15] And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. [16] But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. [17] And he said unto them, What7 communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk ? And they stood still, looking sad. [18] And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost8 thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days? [19] And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: [20] and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. [21] But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass. [22] Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb; [23] and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. [24] And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. [25] And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in9 all that the prophets have spoken! [26] Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? [27] And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. [28] And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.

[33] And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, [34] saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

<p>[36] And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and11 saith unto them, Peace be unto you. [37] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. [38] And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart? [39] See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having. [40] And12 when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. [41] And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?

<p>[44] And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me. [45] Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures; [46] and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day; [47] and that repentance and14 remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations,15 beginning from Jerusalem.

<p>(CHRISTIAN)</p>

<p>THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES</p>

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p>The author of "Luke" related in that gospel the story of the life and teachings of Christ, culminating in his rejection and crucifixion by the Jews. In his continuation, "The Acts of the Apostles," the same writer narrates the establishment of the religion of Christ among both Jews and Gentiles, and the beginning of its conquest of the western world. The question of authorship has been touched on in the introductory note to "Luke." The date of composition of the "Acts" is later than that of the gospel, perhaps between 80 and 90 A. D.</p>

<p>Though called "The Acts of the Apostles," this book describes in detail the careers of only two of the apostles, Peter and Paul. The first twelve chapters deal with the founding of the Church in Judaea, Samaria, and Syria, and the beginning of the evangelization of the Gentiles. The main figure in this part is Peter, but his career is not followed to its close. The second part is chiefly occupied with accounts of the missionary journeys of Paul, and the spread of Christianity in the Grasco-Roman world. It closes with the establishment of his ministry in Rome.</p>

<p>In chapters xvi, xx, xxi, and xxvii will be found passages in which the use of "we" seems to imply that the author was himself a member of Paul's party, and it is in this so-called "Diary" that the hand of Luke is most generally acknowledged, even by those critics who do not hold that Luke was the compiler of the gospel and the "Acts" as a whole.</p>

<p>The interest of this book is not confined to the narrative of the travels and work of organization performed by the two apostles; it is enormously increased by the accounts of their preaching. In the reports of the addresses to believers and unbelievers of Peter, Stephen, and Paul, we have an invaluable picture of what the earliest Christian missionaries regarded as the essentials of the new religion, and of the form in which Christianity began its victorious contest with Judaism on the one hand, and paganism on the other.</p>

<p>THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES</p>

<p>THE former1 treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, [2] until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen: [3] to whom he also showed2 himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God: [4] and, being3 assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me: [5] for John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in4 the Holy Spirit not many days hence.</p>

<p>[6] They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? [7] And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set5 within his own authority. [8] But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. [9] And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. [10] And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; [11] who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.</p>

<p>[12] Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey off.</p>

<p>424 THE ACTS</p>

<p>[13] And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James8 and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James6 the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son1 of James.6 [14] These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with8 the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</p>

<p>[15] And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons9 gathered together, about a hundred and twenty), [16] Brethren, it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus. [17] For he was numbered among us, and received his portion10 in this ministry. [18] (Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. [19] And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.) [20] For it is written in the book of Psalms,</p>

<p>Let his habitation be made desolate,</p>

<p>And let no man dwell therein:</p>

<p>and,</p>

<p>His office" let another take. [21] Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among12 us, [22] beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection. [23] And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsab-bas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. [24] And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen, [25] to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place. [26] And they gave lots for13 them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>

<p>THE ACTS</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>[i] And when the day of Pentecost was1 now come, they were all together in one place. [2] And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. [3] And there appeared unto them tongues parting2 asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. [4] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>

<p>[5] Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. [6] And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. [7] And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans? [8] And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born? [9] Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappa-docia, in Pontus and Asia, [10] in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, [11] Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God. [12] And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this? [13] But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.</p>

<p>[14] But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, saying, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words. [15] For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day; [16] but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel: [17] And it shall be in the last days, saith God,</p>

<p>I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh:</p>

<p>And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</p>

<p>And your young men shall see visions,</p>

<p>And your old men shall dream dreams: 1 Gr. was being fulfilled.    2 Or, parting among them.   Or, distributing themselves.</p>

<p>426 THE ACTS</p>

<p>[18] Yea and on my servants3 and on my handmaidens4 in those days</p>

<p>Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. [19] And I will show wonders in the heaven above,</p>

<p>And signs on the earth beneath;</p>

<p>Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke: [20] The sun shall be turned into darkness,</p>

<p>And the moon into blood,</p>

<p>Before the day of the Lord come,</p>

<p>That great and notable day: [21] And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the</p>

<p>Lord shall be saved. [22] Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty5 works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know; [23] him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless6 men did crucify and slay: [24] whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p>

<p>[25] For David saith concerning him,</p>

<p>I beheld the Lord always before my face;</p>

<p>For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: [26] Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;</p>

<p>Moreover my flesh also shall dwell7 in hope: [27] Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades,</p>

<p>Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption. [28] Thou madest known unto me the ways of life;</p>

<p>Thou shalt make me full of gladness with8 thy countenance. [29] Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day. [30] Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he9 would set one upon his throne; [31] he foreseeing this spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did</p>

<p>THE ACTS 427</p>

<p>his flesh see corruption. [32] This Jesus did God raise up, whereof10 we all are witnesses. [33] Being therefore by11 the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear. [34] For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, [35] Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet. [36] Let all12 the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.</p>

<p>[37] Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do? [38] And Peter said unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [39] For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him. [40] And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. [41] They then that13 received his word were baptized: and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand souls. [42] And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship,14 in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</p>

<p>[43] And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.15 [44] And all that believed were together, and had all things common; [45] and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need. [46] And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart, [47] praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to16 them day by day those that were17 saved.</p>

<p>THE ACTS</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>[i] Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. [2] And a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; [3] who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms. [4] And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us. [5] And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them. [6] But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. [7] And he took him by the right hand and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength. [8] And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. [9] And all the people saw him walking and praising God: [10] and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</p>

<p>[11] And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch1 that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. [12] And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man?2 or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk? [13] The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant3 Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him. [14] But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you, [15] and killed the Prince4 of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof5 we are witnesses. [16] And by6 faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. [17] And now, brethren, I know that in</p>

<p>THE ACTS 429</p>

<p>ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. [18] But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. [19] Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord; [20] and that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, even Jesus: [21] whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old. [22] Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like7 unto me; to him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you. [23] And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people. [24] Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days. [25] Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made8 with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. [26] Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant,3 sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>[1] And as they spake unto the people, the1 priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, [2] being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. [3] And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide. [4] But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</p>

<p>[5] And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; [6] and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest. [7] And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? [8] Then Peter, filled with the Holy</p>

<p>7 Or, as he raised up me.    8 Gr. covenanted. 1 Some ancient authorities read the chief priests.</p>

<p>430 THE ACTS</p>

<p>Spirit, said unto tnem, Ye rulers of the people, and elders, [9] if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by2 what means this man is made whole; [10] be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even in him3 doth this man stand here before you whole. [11] He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner. [12] And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.</p>

<p>[13] Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. [14] And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. [15] But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, [16] saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle4 hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. [17] But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. [18] And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. [19] But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: [20] for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard. [21] And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. [22] For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle4 of healing was wrought.</p>

<p>[23] And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them. [24] And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord,5 thou6 that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: [25] who7 by the Holy</p>

<p>THE ACTS 431</p>

<p>Spirit, by the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say,</p>

<p>Why did the Gentiles8 rage,</p>

<p>And the peoples imagine9 vain things? [26] The kings of the earth set themselves in array,</p>

<p>And the rulers were gathered together,</p>

<p>Against the Lord, and against his Anointed :10 [27] for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant11 Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles8 and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, [28] to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel foreordained to come to pass. [29] And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants12 to speak thy word with all boldness, [30] while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant11 Jesus. [31] And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>

<p>[32] And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. [33] And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus:13 and great grace was upon them all. [34] For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, [35] and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.</p>

<p>[36] And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation),14 a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, [37] having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</p>

<p>THE ACTS</p>

<p>V</p>

<p>[i] But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, [2] and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. [3] But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie1 to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land? [4] While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power ? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart ? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. [5] And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it. [6] And the young2 men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.</p>

<p>[7] And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. [8] And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much. [9] But Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out. [10] And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband. [11] And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.</p>

<p>[12] And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.3 [13] But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them; [14] and4 believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women; [15] insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches,5 that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them. [16] And there also came together the multitude from the cities round about Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 433</p>

<p>[17] But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy, [18] and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward. [19] But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said, [20] Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life. [21] And when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought. [22] But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told, [23] saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. [24] Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow. [25] And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people. [26] Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them, but without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. [27] And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, [28] saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. [29] But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men. [30] The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree. [31] Him did God exalt with6 his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins. [32] And we are witnesses of these things;8 and9 so is the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>

<p>[33] But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were minded to slay them. [34] But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a</p>

<p>6 Or, at.    7 Some ancient authorities add in him.    8 Gr. sayings. 9 Some ancient authorities read and God hath given the Holy Spirit to them that obey him.</p>

<p>434 THE ACTS</p>

<p>little while. [35] And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do. [36] For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought. [37] After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment, and drew away some of the people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad. [38] And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown: [39] but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God. [40] And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. [41 ] They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name. [42] And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach10 Jesus as the Christ.</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p>[1] Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian1 Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. [2] And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit2 that we should forsake the word of God, and serve3 tables. [3] Look4 ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. [4] But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word. [5] And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaiis a proselyte of Antioch; [6] whom they set before the aposdes: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 435</p>

<p>[7] And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

<p>[8] And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people. [9] But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called the synagogue of the Libertines,5 and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. [10] And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake. [11] Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. [12] And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council, [13] and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law: [14] for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us. [15] And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p>

<p>VII</p>

<p>[1] And the high priest said, Are these things so? [2] And he said,</p>

<p>Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, [3] and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee. [4] Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, God removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell: [5] and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. [6] And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years. [7] And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God:</p>

<p>5 Or, Freedmen.</p>

<p>436 THE ACTS</p>

<p>and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. [8] And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. [9] And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him, [10] and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. [11] Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. [12] But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. [13] And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's race became manifest unto Pharaoh. [14] And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. [15] And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers; [16] and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor1 in Shechem. [17] But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, [18] till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. [19] The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they2 should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.3 [20] At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding4 fair; and he was nourished three months in his father's house: [21] and when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. [22] And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works. [23] But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. [24] And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian: [25] and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance;5 but they understood not. [26] And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one</p>

<p>again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another ? [27] But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? [28] Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday? [29] And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. [30] And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. [31] And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord, [32] I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold. [33] And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. [34] I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt. [35] This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer6 with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush. [36] This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. [37] This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like7 unto me. [38] This is he that was in the church8 in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us: [39] to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt, [40] saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. [41 ] And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands. [42] But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</p>

<p>[43] And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,</p>

<p>And the star of the god Rephan,</p>

<p>The figures which ye made to worship them:</p>

<p>And I will carry you away beyond Babylon. [44] Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen. [45] Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua9 when they entered on the possession of the nations,10 that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; [46] who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. [47] But Solomon built him a house. [48] Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in houses made with hands; as saith the prophet, [49] The heaven is my throne,</p>

<p>And the earth the footstool of my feet:</p>

<p>What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord:</p>

<p>Or what is the place of my rest? [50J Did not my hand make all these things? [51] Ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye. [52] Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers; [53] ye who received the law as11 it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.</p>

<p>[54] Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. [55] But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, [56] and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. [57] But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; [58] and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. [59] And they stoned Stephen, calling upon the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. [60] And he kneeled</p>

<p>down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p>[i] And Saul was consenting unto his death.</p>

<p>And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. [2] And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. [3] But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.</p>

<p>[4] They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching1 the word. [5] And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ. [6] And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. [7] For2 from many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. [8] And there was much joy in that city.</p>

<p>[9] But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who before-time in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people3 of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: [10] to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great. [11] And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. [12] But when they believed Philip preaching1 good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. [13] And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles4 wrought, he was amazed.</p>

<p>[14] Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: [15] who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit: [16] for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of</p>

<p>the Lord Jesus. [17] Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. [18] Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy5 Spirit was given, he offered them money, [19] saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit. [20] But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money. [21] Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter :6 for thy heart is not right before God. [22] Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. [23] For I see that thou art7 in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. [24] And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>

<p>[25] They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached* the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</p>

<p>[26] But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward9 the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert. [27] And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship; [28] and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. [29] And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. [30] And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? [31] And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him. [32] Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this,</p>

<p>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth: * Some ancient authorities omit Holy.    6 Gr. word.</p>

<p>[33] In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:</p>

<p>His generation who shall declare?</p>

<p>For his life is taken from the earth. [34] And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other? [35] And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached10 unto him Jesus. [36] And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?11 [38] And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. [39] And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. [40] But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached10 the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p>[1] But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, [2] and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. [3] And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven: [4] and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [5] And he said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: [6] but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. [7] And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice,1 but beholding no man. [8] And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. [9] And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.</p>

<p>442 THE ACTS</p>

<p>[10] Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord, [n] And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; [12] and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. [13] But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: [14] and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. [15] But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen2 vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: [16] for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake. [17] And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou earnest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit. [18] And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized; [19] and he took food and was strengthened.</p>

<p>And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus. [20] And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God. [21 ] And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name ? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests. [22] But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</p>

<p>[23] And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him: [24] but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him: [25] but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.</p>

<p>[26] And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. [27] But Barnabas took him, and brought him to</p>

<p>THE ACTS 443</p>

<p>the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. [28] And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem, [29] preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian3 Jews; but they were seeking to kill him. [30] And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Czsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p>

<p>[31] So the church throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified;4 and, walking in5 the fear of the Lord and in5 the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.</p>

<p>[32] And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda. [33] And there he found a certain man named yEneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied. [34] And Peter said unto him, ^Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And straightway he arose. [35] And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</p>

<p>[36] Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas:6 this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. [37] And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. [38] And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us. [39] And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. [40] But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up. [41] And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. [42] And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord. [43] And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</p>

<p>THE ACTS</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>[i] Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band1 called the Italian band, [2] a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. [3] He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius. [4] And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God. [5] And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter: [6] he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. [7] And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; [8] and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</p>

<p>[9] Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour: [10] and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance; [11] and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth: [12] wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. [13] And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. [14] But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. [15] And a voice came unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common. [16] And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.</p>

<p>[17] Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate, [18] and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there. [19] And while Peter thought</p>

<p>1 Or, cohort.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 445</p>

<p>on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. [20] But arise, and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them. [21] And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? [22] And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee. [23] So he called them in and lodged them.</p>

<p>And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. [24] And on the morrow they2 entered into Csesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends. [25] And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped3 him. [26] But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. [27] And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together: [28] and he said unto them, Ye yourselves know how* it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come unto one of another nation; and yet unto me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean: [29] wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me. [30] And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel, [31] and saith, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. [32] Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side. [33] Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the Lord. [34] And Peter opened his mouth, and said,</p>

<p>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: [35] but</p>

<p>2 Some ancient authorities read he.</p>

<p>3 The Greek word denotes an act of reverence, whether paid to a creature or to the Creator.    4 Or, how unlawful it is for a man &c.</p>

<p>446 THE ACTS</p>

<p>in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him. [36] The5 word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good6 tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)[37] that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; [38] even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. [39j And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree. [40] Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest, [41] not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. [42] And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and the dead. [43] To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.</p>

<p>[44] While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word. [45] And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. [46] For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, [47] Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we? [48] And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</p>

<p>XI</p>

<p>[1] Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. [2] And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, [3] saying, Thou wentest in to men uncir-cumcised, and didst eat with them. [4] But Peter began, and expounded the matter unto them in order, saying, [5] I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel 5 Many ancient authorities read He sent the word unto.    6 Or, the gospel.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 447</p>

<p>descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me: [6] upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven. [7] And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. [8] But I said, Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth. [9] But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common. [10] And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven. [11] And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Csssarea unto me. [12] And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man's house: [13] and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter; [14] who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house. [15] And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. [16] And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in1 the Holy Spirit. [17] If then God gave unto them the like gift as he did also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God? [18] And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.</p>

<p>[19] They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews. [20] But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks2 also, preaching3 the Lord Jesus. [21 ] And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord. [22] And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as</p>

<p>448 THE ACTS</p>

<p>Antioch: [23] who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that4 with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord: [24] for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. [25] And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul; [26] and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with5 the church, and taught much people; and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</p>

<p>[27] Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. [28] And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the6 world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius. [29] And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relieF unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea: [30] which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p>

<p>XII</p>

<p>[1] Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. [2] And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. [3] And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And those were the days of unleavened bread. [4] And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people. [5] Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him. [6] And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison. [7] And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. [8] And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. [9] And he went</p>

<p>out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by1 the angel, but thought he saw a vision. [10] And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street and straightway the angel departed from him. [n] And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. [12] And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying. [13] And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda. [14] And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate. [15] And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel. [16] But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed. [17] But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place. [18] Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. [19] And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put2 to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.</p>

<p>[20] Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king's country. [21] And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne,3 and made an oration unto them. [22] And the people shouted, saying, The voice of a god, and not of a man. [23] And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not</p>

<p>[1] Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. [2] And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. [3] Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</p>

<p>[4] So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. [5] And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant. [6] And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer,1 a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus; [7] who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God. [8] But Elymas the sorcerer1 (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith. [9] But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him, [10] and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? [11] And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for2 a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. [12] Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p>

<p>[13] Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem. [ 14 j But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. [15] And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. [16] And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said,</p>

<p>Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken: [17] The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it. [18] And for about the time of forty years as' a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness. [19] And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years: [20] and after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. [21] And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years. [22] And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.4 [23] Of this man's seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus; [24] when John had first preached before5 his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. [25] And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am ? I am not he. But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose. [26] Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth. [27] For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. [28] And though they found no cause of death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain. [29] And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree,</p>

<p>3 Many ancient authorities read suffered he their manners in the wilderness. See Deut. 9. 7.    4 Gr. wills.    5 Gr. before the face of his entering in.</p>

<p>452 THE ACTS</p>

<p>and laid him in a tomb. [30] But God raised him from the dead: [31] and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people. [32] And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers, [33] that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. [34] And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David. [35] Because he saith also in another psalm, Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption. [36] For David, after he had in6 his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: [37] but he whom God raised up saw no corruption. [38] Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: [39] and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. [40] Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets: [41] Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish;7 For I work a work in your days,</p>

<p>A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.</p>

<p>[42] And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath. [43] Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</p>

<p>[44] And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.8 [45] But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.9 [46] And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from</p>

<p>THE ACTS 453</p>

<p>you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. [47j For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying,</p>

<p>I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles,</p>

<p>That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p>

<p>[48] And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God:8 and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. [49] And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region. [50] But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders. [51] But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. [52] And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>XIV</p>

<p>[1] And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. [2] But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren. [3] Long time therefore they tarried there speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. [4] But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. [5] And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them, [6] they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about: [7] and there they preached1 the gospel.</p>

<p>[8] And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked. [9] The same heard Paul speaking: who, fastening his eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, [10] said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. [11] And when the multitudes saw what Paul had done, they lifted 1 See marginal note on ch. 5. 42.</p>

<p>454 ACTS</p>

<p>up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. [ 12] And they called Barnabas, Jupiter;2 and Paul, Mercury,3 because he was the chief speaker. [13] And the priest of Jupiter2 whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes. [14] But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out [15] and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions4 with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: [16] who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations5 to walk in their own ways. [17] And yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. [18] And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.</p>

<p>[19] But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. [20] But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. [21] And when they had preached6 the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch, [22] confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. [23] And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed. [24] And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. [25] And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; [26] and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. [27] And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with</p>

<p>THE ACTS 455</p>

<p>XV</p>

<p>[1] And certain men came down from Judaea and taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved. [2] And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, the brethren appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. [3] They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. [4] And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them. [5] But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.</p>

<p>[6] And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter. [7] And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them,</p>

<p>Brethren, ye know that a1 good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel,2 and believe. [8] And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us; [9] and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. [ 10] Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? [11] But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.</p>

<p>[12] And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them. [13J And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,</p>

<p>1 Gr. from early days.    2 Or, good tidings.</p>

<p>them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles. [28] And they tarried no little time with the disciples.</p>

<p>456 THE ACTS</p>

<p>Brethren, hearken unto me: [14] Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles,3 to take out of them a people for his name. [15] And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</p>

<p>[16] After these things I will return,</p>

<p>And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen;</p>

<p>And I will build again the ruins thereof,</p>

<p>And I will set it up: [17] That the residue of men may seek after the Lord,</p>

<p>And all the Gentiles,4 upon whom my name is called, [18] Saith the Lord, who5 maketh these things known from of old. [19] Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God; [20] but that we write6 unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood. [21] For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</p>

<p>[22] Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: [23] and they wrote thus by them, The7 apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting: [24] Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who8 went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment; [25] it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, [26] men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [27] We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. [28] For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: [29] that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication;</p>

<p>THE ACTS 457</p>

<p>from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.</p>

<p>[30] So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle. [31] And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.9 [32] And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted10 the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. [33] And after they had spent some time there, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.11 [35] But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching" the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>

<p>[36] And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they fare. [37] And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark. [38] But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. [39] And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus; [40] but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. [41] And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p>

<p>XVI</p>

<p>[1] And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek. [2] The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. [3] Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek. [4] And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. [5] So the churches were strengthened in1 the faith, and increased in number daily.</p>

<p>458 THE ACTS</p>

<p>[6] And they went through the2 region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; [7] and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not; [8] and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. [9] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. [10] And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach3 the gospel unto them.</p>

<p>[11] Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; [12] and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days. [13] And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where4 we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together. [14] And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul. [15] And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</p>

<p>[16] And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a5 spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. [17] The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants6 of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the7 way of salvation. [18] And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.</p>

<p>[19] But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone,8 they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the</p>

<p>marketplace before the rulers, [20] and when they had brought them unto the magistrates,9 they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, [21 j and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans. [22] And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates9 rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods. [23] And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: [24] who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. [25] But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them; [26] and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every one's bands were loosed. [27] And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. [28] But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. [29] And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, [30] and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? [31] And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. [32] And they spake the word of the10 Lord unto him, with all that were in his house. [33] And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately. [34] And he brought them up into his house, and set food11 before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having12 believed in God.</p>

<p>[35] But when it was day, the magistrates13 sent the Serjeants," saying, Let those men go. [36] And the jailor reported the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates11, have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace. [37] But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison, and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.

<p>460 THE ACTS</p>

<p>And the Serjeants14 reported these words unto the magistrates:13 and they feared when they heard that they were Romans; [39] and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city. [40] And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted15 them, and departed.</p>

<p>XVII</p>

<p>[1] Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apol-lonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: [2] and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath1 days reasoned with them from the scriptures, [3] opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ. [4] And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. [5] But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people. [6] And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the2 world upside down are come hither also; [7] whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. [8] And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. [9] And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</p>

<p>[10] And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Bercea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. [ 11 ] Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the scriptures daily, whether these things were so. [12] Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few. [13] But when the Jews</p>

<p>15 Or, exhorted.</p>

<p>1 Or, weeks.    2 Gr. the inhabited earth.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 461</p>

<p>of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Bercea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes. [14] And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still. [15] But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>

<p>[16] Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols. [17] So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him. [18] And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say ? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange3 gods:4 because he preached5 Jesus and the resurrection. [19] And they took hold of him, and brought him unto6 the7 Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee? [20] For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. [21] (Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent8 their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.) [22] And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said,</p>

<p>Ye men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very9 religious. [23] For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, To an Unknown God. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you. [24] The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples10 made with hands; [25] neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; [26] and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation; [27] that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him</p>

<p>and find him, though he is not far from each one of us: [28] for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said.</p>

<p>For we are also his offspring. [29] Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the11 Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man. [30] The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth12 men that they should all everywhere repent: [31] inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the13 world in righteousness by14 the15 man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p>

<p>[32] Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again. [33] Thus Paul went out from among them. [34] But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>

<p>XVIII</p>

<p>[1] After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth. [2] And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them; [3] and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought; for by their trade they were tent-makers. [4] And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded1 Jews and Greeks.</p>

<p>[5] But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. [6] And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed,2 he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. [7] And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped</p>

<p>God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. [8] And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed3 in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. [9] And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace: [10] for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city, [n] And he dwelt there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p>

<p>[12] But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat, [13] saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. [14] But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: [15] but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters. [16] And he drove them from the judgment-seat. [17] And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.</p>

<p>[18] And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchrez; for he had a vow. [19] And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. [20] And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not; [21] but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.</p>

<p>[22] And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch. [23] And having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</p>

<p>[24] Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an4 eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures. [25] This man had been instructed5 in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately</p>

But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately. [27] And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped6 them much that had believed through grace; [28] for he powerfully confuted the Jews, and1 that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p>

<p>'    XIX</p>

<p>[1] And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples: [2] and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the1 Holy Spirit was given. [3] And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. [4] And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus. [5] And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. [6] And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. [7] And they were in all about twelve men.</p>

<p>[8] And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of God. [9] But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. [10] And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. [11] And God wrought special miracles2 by the hands of Paul: [12] insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits</p>

<p>THE ACTS 465</p>

<p>went out. [13] But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. [14] And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this. [15] And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know,3 and Paul I know; but who are ye? [16] And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [17] And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. [18] Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds. [19] And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. [20] So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.</p>

<p>[21] Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. [22] And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</p>

<p>[23] And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way. [24] For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver^ shrines of Diana,4 brought no little business unto the craftsmen; [25] whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth. [26] And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands: [27] and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana4 be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the5 world worshippeth. [28] And when they heard this they were filled with</p>

<p>466 THE ACTS</p>

<p>wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana4 of the Ephesians. [29] And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel. [30] And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. [31] And certain also of the Asiarchs,6 being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre. [32] Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. [33] And7 they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defence unto the people. [34] But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana4 of the Ephesians. [35] And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana,4 and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?8 [36] Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash. [37] For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess. [38] If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the9 courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another. [39] But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. [40] For indeed we are in danger to be accused19 concerning this day's riot, there being no cause for it: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse. [41] And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p>

<p>XX</p>

<p>[ 1 ] And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia. [2] And when he had gone through those parts, and</p>

<p>had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece. [3] And when he had spent three months there, and a plot was laid against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia. [4] And there accompanied him as1 far as Asia, Sopater of Bercea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessa-lonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. [5] But these had2 gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas. [6] And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we tarried seven days.</p>

<p>[7] And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight. [8] And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together. [9] And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead. [10] And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him. [11] And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. [12] And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.</p>

<p>[13] But we, going before to the ship, set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by3 land. [14] And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. [15] And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the4 day after we came to Miletus. [16] For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p>[17] And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the</p>

<p>468 THE ACTS</p>

<p>elders5 of the church. [18] And when they were come to him, he said unto them,</p>

<p>Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time, [19] serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews; [20] how I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house, [21] testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.6 [22] And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: [23J save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. [24] But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so7 that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel8 of the grace of God. [25] And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more. [26] Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. [27] For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God. [28] Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops,9 to feed the church of the10 Lord which he purchased11 with his own blood. [29] I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock; [30] and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. [31] Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears. [32] And now I commend you to God,12 and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified. [33] I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. [34] Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. [35]</p>

<p>THE ACTS 469</p>

<p>In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, it is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>

<p>[36] And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all. [37] And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him, [38] sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.</p>

<p>XXI</p>

<p>[1] And when it came to pass that we were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: [2] and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. [3] And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden. [4] And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem. [5] And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell; [6] and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.</p>

<p>[7] And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. [8] And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him. [9] Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied. [10] And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. [11] And coming to us, and taking Paul's girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. [12] And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. [13] Then Paul answered, What do ye,</p>

<p>470 THE ACTS</p>

<p>weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. [14] And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</p>

<p>[15] And after these days we took1 up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem. [16] And there went with us also certain of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing2 with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</p>

<p>[17] And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. [18] And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. [19] And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry. [20] And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands3 there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law: [21] and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. [22] What is it therefore? they will certainly hear that thou art come. [23] Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them; [24] these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law. [25] But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote,4 giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication. [26] Then Paul took5 the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</p>

<p>[27] And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him, [28] crying out, Men of Israel,</p>

<p>1 Or, made ready.    2 Or, bringing us to one Mnason &c.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 471</p>

<p>help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place. [29] For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. [30] And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut. [31] And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief6 captain of the band,7 that all Jerusalem was in confusion. [32] And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief6 captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul. [33] Then the chief6 captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done. [34] And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle. [35] And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd; [36] for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.</p>

<p>[37] And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief6 captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek? [38] Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins? [39] But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people. [40] And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,</p>

<p>xxir</p>

<p>[1] Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you.</p>

<p>6 Or, military tribune.   Gr. chiliarch.    7 Or, cohort.</p>

<p>472 THE ACTS</p>

<p>[2] And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,</p>

<p>[3] I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day: [4] and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. [5] As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished. [6] And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. [7] And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [8] And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. [9] And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. [10] And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. [11] And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus. [12] And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, [13] came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked1 up on him. [14] And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. [15] For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. [16] And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name. [17] And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance, [18] and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me. [19] And I said, Lord, they themselves</p>

<p>1 Or, received my sight and looked upon him.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 473</p>

<p>know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: [20] and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him. [21] And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.</p>

<p>[22] And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. [23] And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air, [24] the chief2 captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him. [25] And when they had tied him up with3 the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? [26] And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief2 captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do ? for this man is a Roman. [27] And the chief2 captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman ? And he said, Yea. [28] And the chief2 captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am a Roman born. [29] They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief2 captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</p>

<p>[30] But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</p>

<p>XXIII</p>

<p>[1] And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day. [2] And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. [3] Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? [4] And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's 2 Or, military tribune.   Gr. chiliarch.    3 Or, for.</p>

<p>474 THE ACTS</p>

<p>high priest? [5] And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people. [6] But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. [7] And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided. [8] For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. [9] And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel? [10] And when there arose a great dissension, the chief1 captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</p>

<p>[11] And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</p>

<p>[12] And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. [13] And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy. [14] And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. [15] Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him. [16] But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and2 he came and entered into the castle and told Paul. [17] And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief1 captain; for he hath something to tell him. [18] So he took him, and brought him to the chief1 captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee. [19] And the chief1</p>

<p>2 Or, having come in upon them, and he entered &c.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 475</p>

<p>captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me? [20] And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul to-morrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him. [21] Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee. [22] So the chief1 captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me. [23] And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night: [24] and he bade them provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor. [25] And he wrote a letter after this form:</p>

<p>[26] Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting. [27] This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. [28] And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I3 brought him down unto their council: [29] whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. [30] And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against4 the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.5</p>

<p>[31] So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. [32] But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: [33] and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him. [34] And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, [35] I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.8</p>

<p>THE ACTS</p>

<p>XXIV</p>

<p>[i] And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul. [2] And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,</p>

<p>Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation, [3] we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. [4] But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. [5] For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the1 world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: [6] who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:2 [8] from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him. [9] And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</p>

<p>[10] And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered,</p>

<p>Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence: [11] seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: [12] and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city. [13] Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me. [14] But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets; [15] having hope toward God, which these also themselves look3 for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust. [16] Herein41 also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 477</p>

<p>[17] Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: [18] amidst5 which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asia[19] who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me. [20] Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council, [21] except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.</p>

<p>[22] But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter. [23] And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</p>

<p>[24] But after certain days, Felix came with DrusiSla, his7 wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. [25] And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me. [26] He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. [27] But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</p>

<p>XXV</p>

<p>[1] Festus therefore, having1 come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. [2] And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him, [3] asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way. [4] Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart thither shortly. [5] Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.</p>

<p>478 THE ACTS</p>

<p>[6] And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. [7] And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove; [8] while Paul said in his defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all. [9] But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? [10] But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest. [11] If 'then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is true whereof these accuse me, no man can give2 me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. [12] Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p>

<p>[13] Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and3 saluted Festus. [14] And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix; [15] about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for sentence against him. [16] To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give2 up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid against him. [17] When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought. [18] Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed; [19] but had certain questions against him of their own religion,4 and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. [20] And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem</p>

<p>2Gr. grant me by favor: and so in ver. 16. a Or, having saluted.    4 Or, superstition.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 479</p>

<p>and there be judged of these matters. [21] But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the5 emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Csesar. [22] And Agrippa said unto Festus, I also could6 wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.</p>

<p>[23] So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief7 captains and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in. [24] And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. [25] But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the5 emperor I determined to send him. [26] Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write. [27] For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.</p>

<p>XXVI</p>

<p>[1] And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:</p>

<p>[2] I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews: [3] especially1 because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. [4] My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; [5] having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. [6] And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers; [7] unto which promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving</p>

<p>5 Gr. the Augustus.    6 Or, was wishing.    7 Or, military tribunes. Gr. chiliarchs. 1 Or, because thou art especially expert.</p>

<p>480 THE ACTS</p>

<p>God night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king! [8] Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead? [9] I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of? Nazareth. [10] And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when, they were put to death I gave my vote against them. [11] And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities. [12] Whereupon2 as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, [13] at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me. [14] And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the3 goad. [15] And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. [16] But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein4 thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee; [17] delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, [18] to open their eyes, that5 they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me. [19] Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: [20] but declared both to them of Damascus first, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.6 [21] For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me. [22] Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come; [23] how7 that the Christ must8</p>

<p>THE ACTS 481</p>

<p>suffer, and how7 that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>[24] And as he thus made his defence, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is9 turning thee mad. [25] But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness. [26] For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner. [27] King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. [28] And Agrippa said unto Paul, With10 but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian. [29] And Paul said, I would to God, that whether11 with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.</p>

<p>[30] And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: [31] and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. [32] And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>

<p>XXVII</p>

<p>[1] And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.1 [2] And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. [3] And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh2 himself. [4] And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. [5] And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. [6] And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein. [7] And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with</p>

<p>9Gr. turneth thee to madness.    10 Or, In a little time thou Src. 11 Or, both in little and in great, i. e., in all respects. 1 Or, cohort.       2 Gr. receive attention.</p>

<p>482 THE ACTS</p>

<p>difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further3 suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone; [8] and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</p>

<p>[9] And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them, [10] and Said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives. [11] But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul. [12] And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there; which is a haven of Crete, looking north-east4 and south-east. [13] And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore. [14] But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo: [15] and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven. [ 16] And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda,5 we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat: [17] and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven. [18] And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the freight overboard; [19] and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling6 of the ship. [20] And when neither sun nor stars shone upon us for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away. [21] And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss. [22] And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. [23] For there stood by me this night an angel of the God</p>

<p>THE ACTS 483</p>

<p>whose I am, whom also I serve, [24] saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee. [25] Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me. [26] But we must be cast upon a certain island.</p>

<p>[27] But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country: [28] and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms. [29] And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished7 for the day. [30] And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship, [31] Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. [32] Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off. [33] And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing. [34] Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you. [35] And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat. [36] Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food. [37] And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. [38] And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. [39] And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive8 the ship upon it. [40] And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. [41 ] But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves. [42] And the 7 Or, prayed.    8 Some ancient authorities read bring the ship safe to shore.</p>

<p>484 THE ACTS</p>

<p>soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. [43] But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land; [44] and the rest, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.</p>

<p>XXVIII</p>

<p>[i] And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.1 [2] And the barbarians showed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. [3] But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by2 reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand. [4] And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live. [5] Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm. [6] But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>

<p>[7] Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius; who received us, and entertained us three days courteously. [8] And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. [9] And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured: [10] who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</p>

<p>[ii] And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The3 Twin Brothers. [12] And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three</p>

<p>1 Some ancient authorities read Melitcne.    2 Or, from the heat. 3 Gr. Dioscuri.</p>

<p>THE ACTS 485</p>

<p>days. [13] And from thence we made4 a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli; [14] where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome. [15] And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>

<p>[16] And when we entered into Rome, Paul5 was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</p>

<p>[17] And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those6 that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: [18] who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me. [19] But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation. [20] For this cause therefore did I entreat7 you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. [21] And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee. [22] But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</p>

<p>[23] And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded the matter, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening. [24] And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. [25] And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, [26] saying,</p>

<p>4 Some ancient authorities read cast loose. 5 Some ancient authorities insert the centurion delivered the prisoners to the Chief of the camp: but Src.</p>

<p>6 Or, those that were of the Jews first.</p>

<p>486 THE ACTS</p>

<p>Go thou unto this people, and say,</p>

<p>By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;</p>

<p>And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: [27] For this people's heart is waxed gross,</p>

<p>And their ears are dull of hearing,</p>

<p>And their eyes they have closed;</p>

<p>Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,</p>

<p>And hear with their ears,</p>

<p>And understand with their heart,</p>

<p>And should turn again,</p>

<p>And I should heal them. [28] Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.8</p>

<p>[30] And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him, [31] preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.</p>

<p>8 Some ancient authorities insert ver. 29, And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</p>
